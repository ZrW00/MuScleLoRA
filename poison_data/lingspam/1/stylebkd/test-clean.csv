32,"from speech perception to a behavioral principle ( mit press , cambridge , mass . ) . 552 pp . , 212 illus . , 1 cd-rom . $ 55 . 00 . reviewed byl noel nguyen , laboratory for psycholinguistics , fpse , university of geneva , switzerland ( nnguyen fapse . unige . ch ) . 1 synopsis 1 . 1 general outline this book is concerned with how multiple sources of information are processed in speech perception and , more generally , in pattern recognition . it is based upon an important research programme conducted by massaro and his colleagues over the last two decades . the book focuses on the perception of so-called bimodal speech , addressing a wide range of issues about the way in which visual information ( as provided by the speaker 's face ) and auditory information are combined with each other by the perceptual system . the scope of the book is much larger , however , as massaro 's purpose here is to describe and defend a new psychological law relevant to a wide variety of domains . in contrast to already well-established laws of the same kind ( e . g . weber 's law of perception ) , which are all unidimensional , the new principle is multidimensional , in that it describes how several factors impact behaviour . this principle is embodied in a computational model of pattern recognition , the fuzzy logical model of perception ( flmp ) , whose latest version is presented and discussed in detail . the flmp is systematically contrasted with alternative computational models , using a broad perceptual database as benchmark throughout the book . in a separate part , the book also deals with methods for synthesizing talking faces in experiments on bimodal speech perception , and introduces baldi , the talking face developed by massaro and his coworkers . the book is accompanied by a cd-rom which contains a series of demonstrations relating to many of the topics dealt with . the book is divided into four main sections . section 1 , "" perceiving talking faces "" , focuses on the perception of speech by ear and eye . massaro reviews the most significant empirical findings in that domain , discusses the main methodological issues , and presents a general classification of the existing computational models of bimodal speech perception . central to this section is the idea that speech perception obeys a general behavioural principle of integration between different sources of information . section 2 , "" broadening the domain "" , aims at assessing how well this principle holds up across broad individual and situational variability . the author demonstrates that inter-individual variations in how bimodal speech is perceived , depending on the listener 's age or native language for instance , can be accounted for within the flmp framework . using examples taken from different perceptual and cognitive situations , massaro also defends the idea that the flmp adequately describes information processing irrespective of these situational differences . section 3 , "" broadening the framework "" , opens with a presentation of an extended and more explicit version of the flmp , designed in particular to account for the dynamics of speech processing . the section also includes a detailed analysis of the methodological issues involved in assessing quantitative predictions in psychology , along with a discussion of the critiques expressed by other investigators about the flmp over the years . finally , section 4 , "" creating talking faces "" , is specifically dedicated to the synthesis of visual speech . 1 . 2 the new behavioural principle although many readers may already be familiar with massaro 's fuzzy logical model of perception , i shall here assume the contrary , and proceed to present a brief outline of the model . a central assumption of the flmp is that pattern recognition involves a common set of processes regardless of the specific nature of the patterns . speech is not seen as being associated with a dedicated processing module , as in the motor theory of speech perception ( liberman , 1996 ) for instance . on the contrary , the sensory information is assumed to be processed in the same way whether our brain is busy recognizing speech sounds , letters , or manual gestures , to take but a few examples . in any of these cases , the flmp postulates that mapping a stimulus into a unique perceptual category entails going through three main stages of processing , the feature evaluation stage , the feature integration stage , and the decision stage . the evaluation stage consists of converting the available sources of information into a set of properties referred to as features . each feature is given a continuous ( fuzzy truth ) value , and represents the degree to which the stimulus corresponds to each of a set of internal prototypical patterns , along a particular perceptual dimension . thus , one important visual feature in the perception of cv syllables is the degree of opening of the lips . the model therefore assumes that the internal prototypes available to the perceptual system will specify that the lips are open at the onset of the syllable for / da / , closed for / ba / , etc . in a second stage , the features are integrated with each other , so as to determine the overall degree of match of the sensory input with each of the prototypes ( e . g . each of the syllables known to the receiver ) . in the third and final stage , a decision is taken , on the basis of the relative goodness of match of the input with each prototype . the flmp makes a number of specific assumptions at each stage in this process . first , it hypothesizes that all of the available sources of information are simultaneously brought into play in pattern recognition . thus , visible speech and auditory speech are both assumed to have an influence on how bimodal speech is perceived . second , different sources of information are assumed to be evaluated independently of each other . this means for example that visible speech does not have any effect on how auditory speech is converted into a set of features , the two sources of information being combined at a later stage of processing only . the model also makes specific assumptions about how sources of information are integrated with each other ( multiplicative rule ) , and about how decisions are taken ( relative goodness rule ) . a major prediction of the model is that "" the influence of one source of information is greatest when the other source is neutral or ambiguous "" ( 19 ) . this prediction is best illustrated by an experiment whose results served as a database for testing models of pattern recognition on several occasions in the book ( chapters 2 and 11 ) . in this experiment , synthetic auditory stimuli ranging on a continuum between / ba / and / da / were crossed with visual stimuli also varying between / ba / and / da / . the bimodal stimuli were presented to subjects in a forced-choice identification task , along with each of the unimodal stimuli . ( this expanded factorial design is shown by massaro to be the most appropriate experimental design for determining how two sources of information are combined with each other in pattern recognition . ) for the bimodal stimuli , the main results are typically depicted as a two-factor plot , with the proportion of / da / responses on the ordinate , the levels of the auditory source of information on the abscissa , and a different curve for each of the levels of the visual source of information . when represented in that way , the results clearly show a statistical interaction between the two sources of information . specifically , the influence of one source of information proves to be larger in the middle , ambiguous range of the other source . this interaction graphically takes the shape of an american football , which is for this reason presented throughout the book as the hallmark of the the fuzzy logical model of perception . in summary , massaro proposes a universal principle of perceptual cognitive performance to explain pattern recognition . according to this principle , "" people are influenced by multiple sources of information in a diverse set of situations . in many cases , these sources of information are ambiguous and any particular source alone does not usually specify the appropriate interpretation . the perceiver appears to evaluate the multiple sources of information in parallel for the degree to which each supports various interpretations , integrate them together to derive the overall support for each interpretation , assess the support of each alternative based on all of the alternatives , and select the most appropriate response . "" ( p . 291 ) . 2 critical evaluation 2 . 1 general evaluation this book is clearly a major contribution to the study of speech perception and , more generally , to cognitive psychology . it is admirably clear and is written in quite an elegant manner . i do not doubt that the book will be read with great interest by research scientists from many different fields . this work is the result of an ambitious intellectual endeavour aimed at introducing a new behavioural law , which is placed by massaro on an equal footing with weber 's law of perception , or the power law of learning . speech scientists are presented with an extensive series of experiments on the perception of bimodal speech . whatever stance they take in that domain , they should find quite challenging massaro 's view that speech perception constitutes but one aspect of a much more general form of cognitive processing , namely pattern recognition . computer scientists working in the field of speech technology should be particularly interested in the book 's final section about the synthesis of visual speech . regardless of their background , readers should also find the book worth using as a tutorial on the experimental methods available for investigating speech perception . a great variety of experimental paradigms and tasks are discussed at length by massaro , who also extensively discusses the methods for assessing computational models of pattern recognition and , in particular , for fitting these models to observed results . in that respect , using the results of the experiment described above as a reference database was quite a good initiative in my view , as this allows the reader more easily to understand massaro 's point as new issues are raised , without having again to go through the details of the experimental design each time . the book should also prove an invaluable resource for teaching . care was taken to select prototypical results , as well as to set this work in its historical context . a number of rather fascinating anecdotes and historical references are given , going from mcgurk 's personal account of the discovery of the mcgurk effect , to an audio-visual rendition of the introduction to george miller 's seminal article on the ubiquitousness of the number 7 plus or minus 2 , with miller 's face texture-mapped onto baldi 's wire-frame head . the cd-rom that accompanies the book enables the reader directly to experience the psychological illusions associated with the perception of bimodal speech , and constitutes as such a most useful research and teaching tool . on the negative side , massaro 's use of the / ba / - / da / experiment as a leading strand throughout obviously results in the book being focused on the perception of non-sense syllables . although the interaction of visible speech and audible speech in word recognition is mentioned on a number of occasions ( e . g . pp 21-23 and pp . 181-182 ) , the book contains few suggestions as to how we perceive isolated words , let alone connected speech . i also was surprised by the fact that little place was devoted to presenting other current theories and models of speech perception . although models such as trace are mentioned on several occasions in the book , i think it is fair to say that the flmp is still given the lion 's share . the book also has some minor defects such as the absence of a list of figures , and the fact that some of the cd-rom bands ( 1 . 4 , 1 . 5 and 1 . 6 ) are referred to incorrectly in the text . the list of the cd-rom selections should have pointed to the pages where each band is referred to . in another domain , it would have been quite interesting to have the perceptual database used in the book made available on the cd-rom . although this would have probably required a substantial amount of additional work , i should also have found it useful to be provided with an interactive version of the main computational models discussed in the book ( flmp , the race model , the single channel model , etc . ) . the flmp model can be downloaded from massaro 's laboratory web site at santa cruz ( http the feature evaluation stage , the feature integration stage , and the decision stage . specific assumptions are made in the model about how features are integrated with each other , and how a decision is taken depending on the outcome of this integration . from a set of feature values , therefore , the model will predict the probability of occurrence of each possible response ( e . g . "" ba "" and "" da "" ) . however , attention should be paid to the fact that these feature values are in no way derived from the stimulus . they are actually determined in an posteriori manner , from the subjects ' observed responses , using an algorithm ( stepit ) which allows the deviation between these responses and the predicted ones to be minimal . features are seen in the model as * free parameters * , whose values are set on the basis of the actual performance of the subject in the pattern recognition task , so as to make the model perform at its best , i . e . to maximize its goodness of fit . according to massaro , "" [ the model is ] * predicting * the exact * form * of the results , but * postdicting * the actual quantitative * values * that make up the overall predictions "" ( p . 294 , his emphasis ) . in other words , the stimulus is on no occasion explicitly mapped onto the internal features of the flmp model . in that respect , features as defined in the flmp look markedly different from phonetic features . let us take for example the opposition between / ba / and / da / , on which much emphasis is put in the book . acoustically , / b / and / d / are said to differ from each other according to the feature grave-acute , / b / being classified as grave and / d / as acute . as is the case with flmp features , grave and acute can be viewed as target values referring to prototypical stops . however , the grave-acute feature is explicitly defined in acoustical terms ( e . g . slope of the short-term spectrum at the release of the stop , see stevens & blumstein , 1978 ) . on the contrary , the exact nature of the flmp features remains undetermined , their values being subject to one main constraint which is to make the model account for the subjects ' responses as accurately as possible . thus , the acoustic structure of the stimulus is not directly taken into consideration in the estimation of the feature values . in the experiments using audible speech , flmp features do lend themselves to an acoustic interpretation . in the / ba / - / da / experiment for example , the prototypes for / ba / and / da / are assumed to include one auditory feature , namely the variations in frequency of the second ( f2 ) and third ( f3 ) formants at the onset of the vowel ( slightly falling f2-f3 for / da / , rising f2-f3 for / ba / ) . however , this interpretation stems from the fact that f2 and f3 onset frequencies were precisely the acoustic parameters manipulated by the experimenters to synthesize the auditory continuum between / ba / and / da / . in other words , the acoustic significance of the flmp features is derived from the way in which the experiment has been designed . the model does rely on a particular system of acoustic features ( see for example stevens & blumstein , 1978 , for an alternative system ) , but this system is embodied in the experimental design , and is as such external to the model itself . in practice , therefore , the issue of how speech sounds are mapped onto features is not addressed in the model . why this is so is not clear to me . on several occasions , massaro suggests that determining in advance how a given individual will convert a given stimulus into a set of feature values is simply out of our reach . this stimulus-to - feature mapping shows a variability which is said to be analogous to the variability of the weather a special code ( mit press , cambridge , mass . ) . mcclelland , j . l .

57,"a multidisciplinary perspective guest editors itiel e . dror and sarah v . stevenage in many senses , faces are at the center of human interaction . at a very basic level , faces indicate identity . however , faces are remarkably rich information carriers . for example , facial gestures may be used as means of conveying intentions . faces may also permit a direct glimpse into the person 's inner self ( by unintentionally revealing , for example , aspects of character or mood ) . given their salient role , the processing of the information conveyed by faces and its integration with other sources of interactional information raise important issues in cognition and pragmatics . research on facial information processing has investigated these ( and other ) issues utilizing a variety of approaches and methodologies , and developments in both computer and cognitive sciences have recently carried this research forward . the emerging picture is that there are cognitive subsystems which specialize in different aspects of facial processing . this has been supported by neuropsychological evidence suggesting that brain damaged patients show dissociations between the different aspects of face processing . in addition , research on the development of facial processing abilities , and on aspects of the face itself which affect these processing abilities , has contributed to our understanding of how facial information is perceived . this special issue of pragmatics and cognition is intended to provide a common forum for a variety of the topics currently under investigation . given the breadth of issues and approaches used to investigate faces , we encourage submissions from a wide range of disciplines . our aim is that this special issue will tie together the diverse research on faces , and show their links and interdependencies . deadline for submission november 1 , 1998 revised papers due october 1999 papers should be submitted according to the guidelines of the journal ( see www url / / www . cogsci . soton . ac . uk / ~ dror / guideline . html ) . all submissions will be peer reviewed . please send five copies of your submission either to dr . sarah stevenage ( svs1 soton . ac . uk ) dept . of psychology southampton university highfield , southampton so17 1bj england for additional and updated information see www url / / www . cogsci . soton . ac . uk / ~ dror / faces . html or contact either of the guest editors . = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = | itiel e . dror , ph . d . http : / / www . cogsci . soton . ac . uk / ~ dror / | | department of psychology dror coglab . psy . soton . ac . uk | | university of southampton office 44 ( 0 ) 1703 594519 | | highfield , southampton lab . 44 ( 0 ) 1703 594518 | | england so17 1bj fax . 44 ( 0 ) 1703 594597 | = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *",0,0

how are sign languages understood in real time ( specifically , what mechanisms are required to interpret co-reference conveyed spatially ? what are the effects of late language acquisition on language processing ? how does experience with a signed language impact non-linguistic visual-spatial cognition ( specifically , face processing , memory , and imagery ) ? what is the nature of working memory for sign language ? what is the neural organization for signed and spoken language ? specifically , what brain areas are involved in the comprehension and production of spatial language ( i . e . , describing space with classifiers or prepositions ) ? dr . emmorey 's keynote address will focus on only a small subset of these questions . she will address the consequences of using signing space to describe physical space for language and cognitive processing . dr . carol padden dr . padden received her bachelor of science degree in linguistics from georgetown university , and her ph . d . , also in linguistics , from the university of california at san diego . her current work is in the area of reading ability in signing deaf children , and areas of interest include reading research with signers the use of classifier signs as free forms in noun phrases in narrative discourse in swedish sign language ; the use of handshapes and movements as bound morphemes in signs describing shape and size of the entities in swedish sign language . pre-conference workshop thursday , november 12 , 2 00 p . m . we are offering a workshop for those who are not familiar with theoretical linguistic issues . we will define phonology , morphology , syntax , language acquisition , and sociolinguistics , and discuss what each discipline is all about . this will give participants an opportunity to catch up with current , hot issues that conference presenters will be discussing . we will also briefly describe the presenters works , views and arguments and compare how each presenter s works are similar or different from others . the workshop will take place before the conference begins . it is designed to help you gain confidence and be able to participate effectively during the conference . please note that if you plan to participate in the pre-conference workshop , you must pre-register for the conference by october 9 . registration deadline $ 30 conference registration for information related to registration and accommodations . college for continuing education attn : tislr ' 98 gallaudet university kellogg conference center 800 florida avenue , ne washington , dc 20002-3695 u . s . a .

67,"this workshop will focus on the required functionality , techniques , and evaluation criteria for multimedia information retrieval systems . researchers have been investigating content-based retrieval from non-text sources such as images , audio and video . initially , the focus of these efforts were on content analysis and retrieval techniques tailored to a specific media ; more recently , researchers have started to combine attributes from various media . the goal of multimedia ir systems is to handle general queries such as "" find outdoor pictures or video of clinton and gore discussing environmental issues "" . answering such queries requires intelligent exploitation of both text / speech and visual content . multimedia ir is a very broad area covering both infrastructure issues ( e . g . efficient storage criteria , networking , client-server models ) and intelligent content analysis and retrieval . since this is a one-day workshop , we have chosen three focus areas in the intelligent analysis and retrieval area . about the workshop - content analysis and retrieval from various media ( text , images , video , audio ) - interaction of modalities ( e . g . text , images ) in indexing , retrieval - effective user interfaces ( permitting query refinement etc . ) - evaluation methodologies for multimedia information . we have found that researchers pay insufficient attention to it . - techniques for relevance ranking - multimodal query formation / decomposition - logic formalisms for multimodal queries - indexing and retrieval from scanned documents - e . g extracting text from images , word spotting - as a retrieval technique for both handwritten and printed documents . - testbeds for evaluating multimodal retrieval two types of participation are expected . those interested in making a presentation at this workshop should submit their full papers either in online postscript version or in hardcopy by regular mail to the address given below . the papers should not exceed 5 , 000 words , including figures , tables , and references . those interested in participating , but not presenting papers , should submit a statement of interest , not to exceed 500 words . this should clearly state what aspect ( s ) of the workshop reflect their research interest . these will be used to select panelists . both types of submissions are due on friday , june 5th . decisions will be made no later than friday , june 26th . in the case of paper submission , the final camera-ready papers are due on july 24th . working notes will be made available to all participants at the workshop . all the submissions should be sent to workshop chairs ( also program chairs ) rohini k . srihari , suny at buffalo ( rohini cedar . buffalo . edu ) zhongfei zhang , suny at buffalo ( zhongfei cedar . buffalo . edu ) r . manmatha , university of massachussetts ( manmatha cs . umass . edu ) s . ravela , university of massachussetts ( ravela cs . umass . edu ) program committee members paper or statement of interest submission july 19th , 1998 camera - ready paper due august 24th - 28th , 1998 workshop further questions may be directed to the address above , or go to the web page of this workshop at http / / www . cs . mu . oz . au / sigir98 /",0,0

71,"0 304 33908 3 , are we creatures who learn new things ? or does human mental development consist of awakening structures of thought ? a view has gained ground - powerfully advocated , for example , by stephen pinker 's book the language instinct - that language in much of its detail is hard wired in our genes . others add that this holds too much of the specific knowledge and understanding expressed in language . when the first human eve evolved from pre-human apes ( it is claimed ) , her biological inheritance comprised not just a distinctive anatomy but a rich structure of cognition . despite the impressive roll of converts that these ideas have gained , there is no good reason to believe them . pinker 's and other 's arguments depend on earlier and more technical contributions , by writers such as noam chomsky . many readers take these foundations on trust , not realising how weak they are . this book examines the various arguments for instinctive knowledge , and finds that each one rests on false premises or embodies a logical fallacy . a different picture of learning is suggested by karl popper 's account of knowledge growing through ' conjectures and refutations ' . the facts of human language are best explained by taking language acquisition to be a case of popperian learning . eve was not born a know-all . she was born knowing nothing , but able to learn anything . that is why we can find ways to think and talk about a world that goes on changing today . geoffrey sampson is a reader in computer science and artifical intelligence at the unibersity of essex , uk . this book is priced 45 pounds and is available at any good bookshop or in case of difficulty contact cassell on 01202 665432 . thanks very much joanne coen , cassell",0,0

"" making sense "" sounds reassuringly uncontroversial , and it has taken the insights of jerome bruner in the 1960s , and of michael halliday and his associates in recent years , to bring out the richness of meaning that this expression can carry . it is now widely accepted that sense is not simply "" there "" in the world , waiting to be discovered and documented , but that it is actually created by human beings in societies . the idea that "" reality "" is "" created "" in language also implies that there must be more than one reality , and that a number of realities can be articulated and compared . these possibilities carry major implications for language education , social identity and participation - - - or , less reassuringly , for educational and social exclusion . the thematic emphasis of this conference on "" creating sense "" , then , includes the essential notions that any single form of sense can also be questioned and "" unmade "" , and that alternative kinds of sense can be remade or "" re-created "" through texts . making , unmaking and remaking meanings are fundamental aspects of social and educational experience , from infancy through primary and secondary school years and beyond , continuing into adulthood and maturity . much education has to do with learning to think , talk and write about things in ways that differ from the initial "" commonsense "" knowledge or belief that children have already acquired in their communities . to bring this about without undermining what is valid and valued in children 's lives is an enormously challenging and problematic social and cultural activity . that it is also a necessary one can be argued both in terms of mainstream rationality ( the development of scientific thinking being a prime example here ) and of critical awareness , which includes learning to deconstruct powerful people 's accounts of how the world is and ought to be , and to propose alternative accounts . full participation in social and political life is only possible when people have learned , as ronald carter has put it , how to "" see through language "" . these concerns over creating , questioning and re-creating sense are explored in this conference in relation to two domains , those of language education and media studies . in the context of formal education , learners have both to discern meaning in what is offered to them and actively to make "" their own "" meanings as they interpret and analyse experience from a variety of perspectives which may be proposed to them or discovered by them . all this raises important issues of participation and exclusion relating to learners ' personal and social explorations of language , and the ways in which these two modes of exploration may be related . the conference will pursue these concerns in the broad context of language education as its first domain . the second conference domain is that of media studies , with particular attention to media discourse and reality construction . the conference seeks to bring to light some of the ways in which realities , like stories , are invented , told , represented and mediated through available technologies . diverse experiences and accounts of reality are constructed through the interplay of language and image . these can , for instance , be presented as fantasies , fictional explorations of experience , docu-dramas or documentary coverage of events , among other things . the impact of such accounts on audiences and "" the public "" depends on many social , cultural and educational factors , but the need for modern citizens to be able to make their own sense of accounts that are offered to them , and also to offer accounts of their own , increasingly appears fundamental to effective social participation as well as to social critique . the conference looks to stimulate debate that is grounded in - - - or informedly set against - - - current theories , practices and findings of teaching and research communities in language and communication studies . another main aim is to suggest guidelines for informed , responsible and reflective practice in the domains of language education and mediaoa studies . a theme of particular interest , to be developed especially in workshop mode , is that of materials writing for educational purposes in both conference domains .",0,0

overall travel time is therefore about three hours , plus time for connections . tickets from london ( king 's cross ) to york are priced according to a bewildering system . if you are traveling on friday ( which is more expensive than other working days ) , you will pay about gbp 61 . 00 for a ticket with return , which may have some restrictions . you will pay more than gbp 100 . 00 for a ticket that is valid on any train . see information above for travel time and train frequency . for maps and additional travel information , visit the web site http registration fee gbp 12 optional conference banquet ( sunday ) gbp 16 and up meals ( lunch + dinner , per day ) . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . affiliation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . telephone . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . e - mail . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . card number . . . . . . . . . billing address . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . fill in the appropriate boxes and the total amount . registration fee digs 5 department of language and linguistic science university of york heslington , york yo1 5dd united kingdom",0,0

184,"watt , phonology of intonation . watt , david l . e . 1994 . _ the phonology and semology of intonation in english indiana university linguistics club publications . 192pp . paper . reviewed by karen steffen chung < karchung ccms . ntu . edu . tw > good books on intonation are not that easy to come by , in this reviewer 's opinion , but this should be considered one of them . it is not an introductory text that will take you through english intonation in a systematic way . and the book 's ostensible main thesis , which concerns the semantic interpretation of various intonation ' melodies ' , is not its primary attraction , either . what it offers is a solid collection of valuable observations , in bits and pieces , on english intonation . so i think that the best way to do justice to a book like this in a review is to simply pick out what i found to be some of the more interesting points and condense them here , without too much additional commentary . * * * * * * * * intonation as a subfield of linguistics is still wide open to pioneering work . the author describes intonation as one of the ' most puzzling and idiosyncratic ' aspects of human speech within the sphere of language as behavior , and he points out the role of intonation in the 'd ynamism of discourse ' ( from the preface ) . unlike another work in this series recently reviewed for linguist , taylor 's _ a phonetic model of intonation in english _ , this book focuses mainly on * language * as we speak and hear it , rather than on mechanical - and often difficult-to - interpret - computer models , though computer recorded and analyzed data is also used to help analyze stretches of speech in this study . watt concludes that since instrumentation is far from infallible , and the human ear can also be quite subjective in what it hears , the most reliable method is to use auditory impressions for the initial recording of data , and instrumentally collected data as a supplement . the book starts out with a useful introduction , in which terms are defined and goals set . the two sections of the main body stress the development of a phonological and semantic model of intonation , respectively . these are divided into two chapters each , entitled ( part i ) "" intonation and meaning "" , and "" the semantics of phonological gradience "" . two appendices of instrumental data from recorded speech consist of selected examples taken from halliday 's _ course in spoken english i . e . attitudes toward a message , such as reservation , certainty or assertion ( pp . 18-20 ) . also defined is _ paratone _ , a larger intonational unit , which cannot extend beyond a breath group ; and no larger intonational unit was found in this study . section one begins by proposing that a theory of intonation must strive to make two different kinds of descriptions , namely , ( 1 ) a phonological one , which emphasizes identification of nuclear tones and other refinements derived from instrumental analysis , and ( 2 ) a semantic description of the functional impetus responsible for motivating language behavior , which includes tone sequences , intertonal relations , paratones , and connected speech . section one concentrates on ( 1 ) . watt describes _ simple tones _ - namely ( 1 ) simple falling , ( 2 ) simple high rise ( with fall-rise option ) , and ( 3 ) low rise - and _ complex tones _ , which consist of more than one pitch movement and are naturally more complicated . these are ' the phonological resources for signaling meaning are far fewer than the semantic functions which "" exploit "" them ' ( p . 73 ) . a notable pattern revealed by instrumental analysis of spoken data is _ downdrift _ , a declining of the fundamental frequency ( f0 ) over the span of short utterances for a wide range of languages . it oscillates between the two extremes of an equally descending and slightly narrowing bandwidth with sentence final fall and slight prolongation at the breath group boundary . the declination slope is not always constant , but it can be a series of descending plateaux , or sets of declination lines . this model is not as 's usceptible ' to errors of data interpretation as following individual nuclear tones can be ( pp . 66-71 ) . section two concentrates on developing a semantic model of intonation , i . e . providing an initial account of meaning often attributed to intonation . watt here advances his view that intonational meaning can be derived both from phonological contrasts of tone and tonicity and from the phonetic gradience characteristic of these contrasts . there is less consistency in generalizing the meaning of intonation than with a phonological description of sound substance due to ( 1 ) the nature of intonation and ( 2 ) the variety of inferences people draw from voice-related cues . as members of a speech community , we make inferences about what is meant both by what is said and how it is said . we must draw conclusions on discrete meanings from only * part * of the speech continuum ( and not include e . g . physical appearance of the speaker in our analysis ) . to deal with the semantics of intonation , you can take either a linguistic approach , in which you look at meaning * contrasts * and form-to - function correspondences , or you can take a psychological approach , in which ' polar clines ' are posited , e . g . bored vs . interested , or timid vs . confident ; watt addresses only the * linguistic * contribution of ' tonicity ' and ' tone ' ( p . 76 ff . ) . watt refers to halliday , who stresses the ideation function of intonation , how it highlights information for specific attention , i . e . given vs . new , also fresh vs . contrasted . the stressing of new information is an outcome of 's peaker assessed importance ' . the tonic of unmarked utterances will tend to fall on the last lexical item of the tone group ; this results in a broad , ' unspecified ' focus ; this focus is narrowed in a ' contrastive ' utterance ( p . 79 ) . intonation has an ' interpersonal metafunction ' by serving as a channel for linguistic expression of * attitude * , though it is not the only such channel . other channels include register and lexicon ; and sometimes certain stylistic effects can be achieved by combining incongruous linguistic content and intonations , e . g . imagine ' put that goddam pipe away ! ' uttered in a smiling , gentle tone of voice . so the listener 's perception of the speaker 's attitude may be based on two or more signals combined ( p . 87 ) . intonation adds information to disambiguate speech function . speech function is identified and interpreted through the cumulative effect of contextual , morpho-syntactic and phonological cues ( p . 91 ) . it can include competition for turns ( an initiating peak can be used for this ) , initiating a topic ( marked by an initial peak of intensity and high pitch ) , continuing ( upward drift ) , responding ( the second speaker approximates the relative pitch height of the baseline of the last utterance produced by the previous speaker , i . e . an accommodation of one speaker 's melodic pattern to that of another ) , terminating ( fall to the lowest level of the speaker 's voice range ; a termination often falls well above the baseline before its final fall ) , checking function ( conversation monitoring with sporadic checks on the status of the conversation , i . e . checking that the hearer understands , agrees on the appropriateness of what is being expressed , and is still engaged ; this is intended to elicit a response from the hearer , but usually involves no change of turn , e . g . ' is n't it ? ' , ' right ? ' , ' you know ' , ' eh ' ) , certainty ( speakers can indicate ' certainty known / absolute ' , ' certainty irrelevant / conditional ' , or ' certainty unknown / assumed ' ) . watt points out that a major difficulty of doing description of intonation is the inherently gradient characteristic of the spoken medium . there is a gradient between the linguistic and the paralinguistic , as well as a division between what constitutes a linguistic contrast and what signals a modification of the phonological cline within that contrast . watt offers a revealing quote from bolinger 240 ] . that is , in watt 's own words ' there is a certain fractal logic that seems to pervade the investigation of intonation . the more we magnify the field under scrutiny , in the hopes of reaching an explanation of its details , the more we find new and unexpected details in need of explanation . the deeper we probe into the next level of detail , the more difficult it becomes to extricate ourselves from its detail with a parsimonious description of the new possibilities ' ( p . 121 ) . in addition to recapping the highlights of his book in the conclusion , watt offers his vision for what his work has to contribute to the field in general , namely , a ' compatible point of departure from which to further the description of discourse ' ( p . 122 ) . he believes that accurate synthesizing of intonations may possibly add to our knowledge about our auditory perceptions , and that can also help further develop our models of synthesized speech . * * * * * * * * although the book 's basic structure is clearly set out in the section and chapter titles , the contents of each subdivision are diverse and often hard to incorporate into a coherent , linear narrative on intonation ; one must content oneself with the fragments one is able to latch onto . yet one has the feeling that much is being said in this motley collection of ideas , observations , and analyses , much more than in many other of the works on intonation available . and for this reason , the interested reader is advised to bear with the author , take notes , and enjoy the ride . this book has a rather amateurish , low-budget look , perhaps to be expected from university publications of this kind . the instrumental graphs bordered by thick black outlines and incorporated into the chapters in many places seem stuffed in a little too close to the written text , though there is no problem of clarity . the text itself is set in a relatively large serif typeface , which makes for comfortable reading , though occasionally some startlingly inconsistent type sizes turn up . new concepts ( e . g . _ paratone _ , _ concord _ ) appear in bold and are easily spotted . minor typos appear here and there . the diy look of the design is not a serious flaw , though , for anyone after unalloyed content , of which you get plenty in this book . overall , this is a worthwhile and rather refreshing book for someone seriously interested in intonation . the reader had better be ready , however , to invest a bit of work to mine it of its wealth . reviewed by karen steffen chung , department of foreign languages and literatures , national taiwan university , taipei .",0,0

187,"early days of sociolinguistics the early days of sociolinguistics summer institute of linguistics . 162 pages , $ 37 ( paper ) . reviewed by joyce milambiling at some point in the 1960 's , along with social and political upheaval , landmark court decisions in education and a host of other social events , the discipline of sociolinguistics emerged . scholars from various other disciplines and places had of course , been doing sociolinguistic research for some time , but it was only in that decade that a group of people started systematically calling it sociolinguistics . why did this happen and who was responsible for the coming together of a talented group of people who often did not ( and to some extent still do n't ) consider themselves to be a cohesive group ? some answers to these questions can be found in this new volume edited by christina bratt paulston and g . richard tucker . the book is sub-titled "" memories and reflections , "" which describes very well the tone of the more than 30 contributions to this book . the contributions range from the editors ' introduction and epilogue , personal accounts from the practitioners and supporters of early sociolinguistic research , and short essays in memory of several important figures in the field . most of the contributions are reflections by a wide range of scholars who were instrumental in the launching of sociolinguistics . the line-up of these early participants in the enterprise of sociolinguistics is impressive ( including joshua fishman , susan ervin - tripp , wallace lambert , dell hymes , charles ferguson and others ) , and creates high expectations on the part of the reader from the outset . these expectations are , for the most part met , with the reader coming away with a real sense of the zeitgeist which allowed sociolinguistics to blossom . the book is based on the premise that if you want to find out what a certain historical period was like , you talk to the the people who were there . the editors provided the contributors with a list of 18 questions , all of which are listed in the introduction of the early days of sociolinguistics ( tedos ) . the main group of contributors , those that the book calls "" pioneers "" in sociolinguistics , come from a wide variety of disciplines and countries ( although the majority are from north america ) . the method by which the editors chose to elicit these memories has many advantages . the range of questions allows the contributors to choose which aspects of the beginning of sociolinguistics they wish ( or are able ) to talk about . most of the questions , in fact , are useful and important for the task at hand . one of these key questions was the interdisciplinary nature of the field and the events that launched it ; the social issues that sparked the emergence of socio - linguistics as a discipline of study ; the importance of a number of key individuals ; the difference between the north american / european perspective and that of researchers from developing countries ; and the important role of a few funding organizations in supporting sociolinguistic research and dialogue . the book is generally well edited with few errors . the bibliography is valuable in that it combines the references from all of the contributed articles into one collective group of books and articles . the one disadvantage to this is that the references have come from scholars working in different fields and thus using different bibliographic styles . a result is that some of the first names are abbreviated while others are written using the full names . this is minor if your discipline abbreviates first names , but is more of a problem if you want to cite or look up a reference and do not have the full first name . there are also a couple of typographical errors bright , william , ed . 1966 . sociolinguistics mouton . chomsky , noam . 1965 . aspects of the theory of syntax . cambridge , ma georgetown university press .",0,0

"" - - donna jo napoli , swarthmore college every human language has some syntactic means of distinguishing a negative from a non-negative sentence ; in other words , every speaker 's syntactic competence provides a means to express sentential negation . this ability , however , may be expressed in different ways , as shown by the fact that individual languages employ different syntactic strategies for the expression of the same semantic function of negating a sentence . zanuttini 's goal here is to characterize the range of such variation by comparing the different syntactic means for expressing sentential negation exhibited by the members of one language family - - the romance languages - - and by reducing the differences we witness to a constrained set of choices available to the particular grammars of these languages . this sort of analysis is a first step towards the ultimate goal of determining and understanding what limits there are on the syntactic options that universal grammar imposes on the expression of sentential negation . september 1997 216 pp . ; 18 charts 0-19 - 508055 - 6 paper $ 39 . 95 oxford university press clause structure and word order in hebrew and arabic from semantics to morphosyntax alessandra giorgi , university of bergamo , italy , and fabio pianesi , institute for technology and scientific research ( irst ) , trento , italy ( oxford studies in comparative syntax ) this book examines the interactions between the morphosyntax and the semantic interpretation of tense and aspect in the germanic and romance languages . these languages diverge not only in their variety of tense and aspectual forms , but also in the distribution and interpretation of given forms . adopting noam chomsky 's minimalist framework , alessandra giorgi and fabio pianesi attempt to provide theoretical explanations for the observed patterns of form and meaning which link the morphosyntactic properties of languages in both universal and language-particular constraints on interpretation . december 1997 336 pp . 0-19 - 509193 - 0 paper $ 35 . 00 0-19 - 509192 - 2 cloth $ 85 . 00 oxford university press for more information about linguistics titles from oxford university press linguistics oup-usa . org or visit the oxford university press usa web site / / www . oup-usa . org oxford university press usa",0,0

computing ' arena and that some of the major and indeed , surprising , achievements in industrial applications come from the application of soft-computing techniques , the two symposia ( iia ' 99 and soco ' 99 ) will have many common areas of interest , namely - iia ' 99 will be directed toward the medium-to - short term , application driven , research area in intelligent technologies . - soco ' 99 is directed toward the long term research in area of soft computing in order to try to overcome the usual borderline existing between theory and application , the two symposia are run jointly , organized in a way to have partial overlap with some joint sessions and some common plenary sessions . aim of iia ' 99 / soco ' 99 1 . to give both a wide and a deep view of advances in ait advancement offered by soft-computing technologies . 2 . to give both the industrial and academic researcher the opportunity to discuss together real problems and opportunities . 3 . to collect ' best practice ' and information on how to perform experiments , tests and design products and processes embedding and / or using soft-computing technologies . 4 . to explicitly and actively function as a ' technology broker ' , giving the opportunity for people to become aware of new problems and possible solutions and giving the possibility of finding technological partners for joint research and / or future application programs . topics of iia ' 99 iia ' 99 will include contributions in the research area of soft computing application and , more in general , related to medium-to - short term and application driven developments advanced information technology and industrial intelligent technology . particular emphasis will be laid on industrial realization , experimental application , application methodology development and / or formalization , quantitative and qualitative problem modeling . contributions are sought mainly in the areas based on the list below -

249,"info dear ion , i am very happy to have found you . i had no idea so many people also = share this interest in figurative language . i find this very exciting = because it 's the language i work in . the operational language of = computers is binary . the operational language of the human mind is = pictures . i use psychotherapy called metaphor therapy that takes all = figurative statements and treats them literally . if you take an = interest in figurative speech , i thought you might like to know more = about this . it 's an approach that looks for the figures in figurative = speech and uses them to heal or dissolve persistent uncomfortable = feelings . the figures of speech that salt out language reflect the inner figures = of the subconscious mind . so , for example , if someone says there 's a = cloud over his or her head , in the subconscious mind there is a cloud . = the cloud feels real internally because the subconscious mind accepts = what it sees as real ( that 's why dreams appear real when the conscious = mind is turned off during sleep ) . = 20 this is important because it 's the key to the inner mind . treating the = figures ( pictures ) as real opens up the subconscious mind because it = accepted the images as real to begin with . these figures and images = reflect our inner world and bring fascinating information to the = surface . working within the realm of a person 's own symbolic = representation of their problem or issue facilitates profound change . = using words that go to the core of our thinking and feelings helps to = change behavior , decisions and choices . = 20 there is a strong connection between figurative language and healing . = that understanding has produced a new verbal technology for entering the = control center of the mind and healing the psyche . it uses the figures = in language to go to the root of the psyche , where thoughts , feelings = and decisions originate . affecting change from this vantagepoint = produces greater satisfaction in personal life and professional = performance . productivity is , above all , a state of mind ; so we can never = underestimate the power of the mind in affecting all realms of health = and happiness . to best gain an improved control of life , we go to the = control center where thoughts and feelings begin . thoughts and feelings = come to conscious awareness without any effort on our part and they come = directly from the conscious mind . the language of the subconscious is = neither english nor japanese , but pictures and images . metaphor therapy is a unique , innovate approach that speaks the same = operational language as the inner mind . the subconscious mind is not = only the very foundation of our ego , thinking and emotions ; it is also = where most depression , anxiety , eating and compulsive disorders , = phobias , obsessive thoughts , urges and unwanted behavior originate . = while this was already known , what 's new is the understanding that = behind each of these symptoms are persistent uncomfortable feelings . what is also new is the ability to speak a therapeutic picture-language = that goes to the inner mind where obstacles begin , and use these = uncomfortable feelings as a trail that leads to the root of almost any = problem . change occurring at the root is always more dynamic than = change at the surface and leads to outward changes , as well . inner = healing promotes outward change , more control and a stronger mind . going directly into the control center of the mind has an added benefit = of recapturing the wholeness and innate strength we were born with . it = is natural that in the course of growing up we lose parts of self as we = adjust to the demands of the world . as children , we may be subject to = abuse , neglect or trauma . our spirit may be broken or bruised along the = way , but we conform and put our feelings aside . as adults , if we ' re = caught in a life threatening situation where death appears imminent , it = takes even more out of us if the ego dissociates just prior to the = event . shutting down as a way of avoiding the event or the feelings = that go with it , the ego goes somewhere else as a way of not letting it = happen . when qualities and characteristics of self are lost , it leaves = a vague , lingering feeling that something is missing . recovering the missing fragments of self and restoring them is not = esoteric nonsense . it is a concrete discipline based on recent = advancements that permit direct access to our inner mind . speaking the = language of the inner mind affords the best opportunity for healing to = occur . restoration of self dissolves a great many negative feelings , and = makes the mind clearer and the will stronger . metaphor therapy = unleashes the strong , innate power within by using the mind 's ability to heal itself , and creates a base of = self-confidence that is genuine and lasting . = 20 i want to get the word out about metaphor therapy . since this may be = some real hope for some people , please share this letter with others . = as for my part , i would be happy to give you any specific information = about the approach or answer any questions you may have . also , if you 'd = like some examples of healings that were accomplished with the use of = figurative language , please let me know . my best , = 20 = 20 drs www . angelfire . com / ak / drsiegel",1,0

320,"morphology new from holland academic graphics _ matter and mind in morphology _ investigates the nature and place of morphology . the underlying assumption is that morphology can be both lexical and syntactic , and that the distinctive properties of the two types of morphology follow from the nature of the lexicon and the syntax respectively . the human language system is argued to consist of a matter - domain and a mind - domain . the matter - domain comprises the syntax as well as the lf and pf modules . its properties ( governing principles , vocabulary , type of categorization ) are those commonly assumed in generative linguistics , and operations taking place in this domain are unconscious and fast . the mind - domain , on the other hand , is a conceptual module where language utterances are matched with a speaker 's knowledge of the world . it makes use of semantic notions ( thematic roles , features like [ + / - human ] or [ + / - animate ] and aspectual notions ) and prototype categorization . processes in this domain are slower and semi-conscious . the lexicon is the interface between the two domains , its main function being the translation of information from one domain into the format of the other . this language model is the basis on which distinctive properties of syntactic and lexical morphology are formulated . in the remaining part of the dissertation , these distinctive properties are used to identify a variety of morphological processes in dutch as either 's yntactic ' , ' lexical ' or ' mixed ' . since the distinction between lexical and syntactic morphology is primarily relevant in the case of word formation based on verbs , the discussion focuses on deverbal processes deriving nouns , adjectives and verbs . the book is aimed at linguists interested in the place and nature of morphology in general and at those investigating dutch deverbal morphology . paperback , xiii + 379 pp .

326,"educating eve g . sampson , ( 1997 ) educating eve 1 age - dependence 3 convergence among grammars 5 species - specificity _ ee _ claims the first argument ( speed of acquisition ) is hollow as there is no way of determining what exactly 's peed ' could be in this area . however , it seems uncontroversial enough that children acquire language faster than adults and that they do so without the problems that adults encounter . there is no attempt in the book to address the notion of whether different languages are acquired at different speeds or whether different children acquiring the same language do so in radically different sequences . this would seem to be a distinct possibility if we do not have an innate language specific faculty but rather rely on some generalised learning mechanism . a look at the evidence regarding language acquisition across languages would have helped make the case conclusive . the book should have dealt more with data available in order to show that only a non-nativist account of language acquisition could capture the facts . instead _ ee _ relies on the notion that the popperian account can cope just as well as a nativist account and is closer to the ' common sense ' view of language . but this does not prove that a popperian account is right . chomsky 's second argument ( age - dependence ) is dismissed because , the book states , humans can learn language at any age "" if they see the task as worthwhile "" ( p . 36 ) . however , the author does not describe any procedure for assessing the worthwhileness of the task . why a child would find it worthwhile to learn a language when its needs are being met by compliant adults responding to non-linguistic communication is not addressed . if the early vocalisations of children are evidence of the beginnings of language acquisition , then the child is deciding at a very early age that language is ' worthwhile ' , at a stage when it seems difficult to believe the child is weighing up any options to see what may or may not be worthwhile . following this logic we could extend the criterion of "" worthwhileness "" to other ' learning ' such as ' learning to walk ' and eliminate the innate component from that as well . the book states that there are "" plenty of cases on record of adults mastering a second language to native-speaker standard apart from accent "" ( p . 36 ) ; i am not quite sure what it might mean to achieve native-speaker standard apart from accent . what the book suggests - without providing any crucial evidence - - is that "" learning as a general process is for biological reasons far more rapid before puberty than after "" ( p . 37 ) . this is supposed to show that age dependence is not proof of a critical period for language acquisition using some innate language acquisition device - - a critical period being one of the features that is characteristic of innate behaviour . the age dependence , according to the book , falls out from the slowing down of the learning process in general after puberty . this , however , seems to contradict the other argument against age dependence ; that an adult can master a second language to native speaker standard . the author also states that "" susan curtiss herself regarded genie as refuting the strong version of lenneberg 's claim , that natural language acquisition cannot occur after puberty "" ( p . 37 ) . susan curtiss might want to respond to that one herself . my understanding of her work on genie is that genie did have language ( that is , rule-governed creative linguistic behaviour ) but was not able to achieve anything close to native speaker competence while under observation ( curtiss , p . 204 ) even though it would indeed have been ' worthwhile ' to do so . furthermore her linguistic development did not follow the same course as children acquiring language normally . this suggests that genie 's ability to learn language was diminished due to her age but the important point is that her cognitive development in other areas seemed not to be so affected . it would also have been worthwhile for chelsea to have learned language , yet chelsea did not achieve native speaker standard ( see jackendoff 's _ patterns in the mind _ ) . the third argument presented by chomsky for nativism , according to the book , is poverty of data during acquisition . the arguments against chomsky presented in the book do not bear close scrutiny . according to the book , motherese provides a "" graded series of language lessons "" ( p . 39 ) and is not at all degenerate , as the poverty of data argument states . this is not particularly new ( the references cited by the author are from the early 70s ) . the fact is , however , that we really do not yet know what role - if any - motherese plays in learning / acquiring a language . but one thing worth noting is that there is no language teaching theory that proposes that adults could be most effectively taught a second language through being taught in motherese . it is also true that there do not yet exist conclusive studies on the universality of motherese ( although the wide variety of language groups studied show a high degree of similarity ) . in some cultures motherese seems to play less of a role and is different to the motherese we see in the english speaking world . in fact motherese or child directed speech seems not to make the task of learning / acquiring language all that much easier but what it does is allow for a high degree of socialisation . this can be seen in the fact that the simplification of structure decreased greatly when the parent and child were no longer in the presence of the observer but merely being taped . the motherese wa s not for the benefit of the child only . of course , if language is not in any way innate we are left with the problem of explaining how child directed speech is so perfectly a "" graded series of language lessons "" for the infant , despite the fact that adults are not taught how to give language lessons , perhaps empiricist would have to say that the ability to give "" a graded series of lessons "" in language is innate . the author states that a popperian account of language learning would allow for a child to determine the general principles from the input ( as it would for an adult who wants to learn a language ) . this is important as the nativist account holds that the basic principles of language are innate and thus are available for use in determining what is going on in the language input . individuals learning a language via a popperian method would use their learning abilities to work out the general principles from the input without any of these principles being already available in the head . but what are we to make of cases of * specific language impairment * where the rate of learning / acquisition a language seems different from other areas of learning ? the whole basis of a popperian analysis is that language acquisition is not different from any other domain where learning occurs . consequently , it predicts that there could be no difference between the acquisition of language and learning in other cognitive domains . this prediction runs counter to reported facts as clearly presented in yamada 's 1990 book ' laura is the man who is talking to bill wearing gloves ? chomsky 's claim is that a child may not encounter such a question in the language s / he hears before determining the rule of yes / no question formation . _ ee _ argues that such sentences are indeed present in the language that children hear . what the book actually has to prove is that all children hear this crucial form of yes / no question before they determine the yes / no question formation rule . this is not shown but instead it is argued that such structures are available to children who read ; but children who do n't read learn language as well . indeed it is quite possible that children form the rule about yes / no question formation before the ever learn to read . the author claims that he shows that chomsky is ' wildly mistaken ' ( p . 42 ) , he paraphrases the situation as follows "" if there was little or no hypotaxis in these languages "" [ the hebrew of the old testament etc . ] "" that is a real difference between them and more recent languages "" . ( p . 75 ) for obvious reasons we can never answer the question of whether or not there was hypotaxis in hebrew before writing or indeed while writing was still a fairly recent innovation . it is true that serious investigation into parataxis and subordination in various languages has been carried out and goes back over one hundred years . the book claims that "" it was a cliche of late nineteenth century linguistics that the early stages of languages with a long recorded history showed a development from what was called parataxis to hypotaxis "" ( p . 74 ) . it cites great linguists like karl brugmann , hermann paul and eduard hermann as support for the notion that languages go from a paratactic stage to a hypotactic stage . but there are two problems with this . firstly , not all nineteenth century linguists would have been happy with the notion that hypotaxis emerged as writing developed . hermann jacobi 's 1897 work ' composition und nebensatz ' concluded that "" maori , like early stages of pie may not have had contained a relative particle "" in subordination ( lehmann , p . 60 ) . so jacobi is claiming that pie did have subordination which is the basis of hypotaxis for brugmann , paul and hermann . secondly , there is really no reason to believe that nineteenth century linguists got everything right in comparative and historical linguistics . the idea that hypotaxis emerged from a previous stage must be seen alongside other ideas in nineteenth century linguistics about the development of languages from primitive systems to more complex systems . the fourth argument the book looks at is convergence among grammars - the notion that people of varying levels of intelligence and exposure to different language inputs , converge on the same grammar . the book claims ( p . 46 ) that chomsky has admitted that educated people may know their mother tongue better . this does not fit in with an i - language approach and so is obviously not representative of chomsky 's theory of language . an i - language approach excludes the possibility of a mother tongue ( an e - language ) that people have mastered to varying degrees . for chomsky such things as english or hungarian or swahili do not exist in any meaningful way . this is controversial , but the point is that for chomsky there is no mother tongue divorced from an individual 's knowledge of it . the second line of argument identified by sampson is that people do not actually converge on the same grammar as they give different grammatical judgments in response to the same data . the book refers to labov 's work - presented in austerlitz ( 1974 ) - where respondents varied in their judgments about the grammaticality of presented sentences . the really interesting thing here is that the people taking the test understood the instructions - oral and written - which they were given concerning the test . it is hard to see how they could all have the same understanding of what was said to them unless they had pretty much the same grammars . the language that was used in their instructions would most likely have contained a variety of syntactic constructions , but there are no reports of the people completing the test remarking on the ungrammaticality of any of the instructions they were given . it is easy to find people varying in groups and even as individuals over time when you ask them to assess sentences such as "" [ bickerton 's ] stuff must be a real hit with green students on hawaii "" . it is surely not too much to expect that personal abuse would be kept out of the realm of intellectual debate . the book also takes on jackendoff stating that jackendoff writes well "" jackendoff has shortly beforehand pointed out that one aspect of american sign language grammar is not paralleled in any spoken language . the sign-language equivalent of the third person pronouns ( she , they , his ) consists of gesturing ( with hand shapes and movements that depend on whether the reference is singular , plural or possessive ) to locations in the signing space which have been assigned to successive topics of conversations . ' the effect is that there are as many different third-person pronouns available as there are discernible locations in the signing space ' . no spoken language has a pronoun system remotely like this , so how can it be part of our innate knowledge . "" ( p . 78 ) the author is missing the point here . sign language expresses person , number , gender and possession as spoken language does and not some other features not found in spoken language . so the system the same as spoken language . the use of pronouns in sign language is exactly the same as the use of pronouns in spoken language and is based on universal grammar , what is different is the modality . the availability of the signing space means that a signer can introduce a greater number of pronouns into the discourse as each pronoun can be allocated a location in the signing space without leading to any confusion . this is the same as the fact that i could use as many second person singular pronouns as i wanted as long as i looked at the individual that i was addressing with that pronoun . looking at the person that i was referring to with the pronoun is really the same as the signer using the sign space to tag pronouns . this is not just true of second person pronouns . i could be talking about , say , the members of a football team and refer to each individual using a third person pronoun . i could be quite clear in my own head who is being picked out each time , it would just be confusing to the person i was talking to . this is because there would be no way for them to distinguish the referents of each of the pronouns . in sign language i can exploit the possibility of the signing space by tagging each meaning of a pronoun with a location in space so that the whole thing does not get confusing . the potential in both oral and sign language is the same , but sign can exploit the signing space in a way that oral language cannot . the point is that the limitations are not imposed by language but by the modality . what jackendoff is saying is that the same universal grammar underlies language no matter what the modality . the last chapter in the book ( ' the creative mind ' ) presents sampson 's view of popper . it is not without problems and the author devotes much time to arguing that popper did n't always mean what he said and that sampson 's analysis of popper is the best . however , the crucial lines in the chapter for the purposes of nature vs . nurture are http r . austerlitz ( ed ) ( 1974 ) , the scope of american linguistics , peter de ridder press . n . chomsky ( 1993 ) , "" naturalism and dualism in the study of language "" , international journal of philosophical studies , 2 ( 2 ) 1 - 61 . s . curtiss ( 1977 ) , genie a case for the modularity of language , mit press . feargal murphy , lecturer in the department of linguistics , university college dublin . http : / / www . ucd . ie / ~ linguist / gogs2 . html",0,0

345,"the revival of shor language school teaching , and of written shor . special attention is paid to problems facing shor turcologists who were providing the revival process with scientific back-up . the article will be fully published in one of the next issues of the journal turkic languages here we present some extracts of it . general information the shors are one of the minor indigenous turkic peoples of siberia . in the former ussr there were slightly over 16 , 000 shors . 12 , 585 of them , according to the census of 1989 , lived in kuzbass ( the kemerovo region ) , in the south of western siberia [ itogi 1989 , 42 ] . . . the shors inhabit mountain shoriya , the northern part of the sayan - altay mountain region . the ethnonym was introduced by the academician v . v . radlov at the end of the nineteenth century . the ethnonym , which came to be used officially , was originally the name of one of the turkic family clans or tribes ( sooks ) who spoke rather similar turkic dialects . the turks of altay also used the terrn ' shor ' for the turkic - speaking population of the kondoma ( shor lfondumj , mrassu ( shor pras ) and tom ( shor tom ) river basins . at that time , this population did not have a general native name . as the official and native name oftthis ethnos , the ethnonym spread in the mid - 1 ^ 30 's , during the beginning of the national cansolidation of the turkic sayan - altay ethnic groups . the ethnic group formed from various turkic and non - turkic sources . the ethnonym ' aba ' , the name of one of tolax sooks , is encountered in chinese sources dating from 603 [ pritsak 1959 , 630 ] . the shors are considered to be turkicized ob - ugrians in the toponymy of shoriya there are a lot of ket names ( e . g . the river names ending in * zas / + sas ) , indicating that the region was inhabited earlier by the kets . many questions of shor ethnic history have not yet been solved . as a separate nation with selfidentification and national sentiment , it formed within the turkic - speaking population of this region during the last three centuries . the shor ethnologist dr . valery kimeev delineates 3 periods of the ethnos history [ kimeev 1994 , 4 - 6 ] . 1 . the formation of territorial ethnic groups of the shors within the administrative ethnic territory ( russian kuzneckij uezd ) , from the beginning of the seventeenth until the beginning of the twentieth century . 2 . national and cultural consolidation in the framework of the autonomous national district ( cor / lo-swo / skij nacional ' nyj / ajon ) , 1926 - 1939 . at that time , the processes of national development were very intensive . the most important contributing factors were the development of the literary language , school instruction in shor and the spreading of literacy among the shor population . 3 . from the early 1940 's until very recently , the shor nation in the conditions of active spreading of the dominant russian culture . within these years the shors lost their literary language and were at the brink of full assimilation . socio - linguistic situation in shordya in the late 1980 's the shor language has survived despite unfavourable circumstances . the fast industrial development of the area in the twentieth century almost destroyed the traditional shor way of life and had a profound influence on the area . the mass inflow of mainly russian speaking migrants initiated assimilation processes which threatened not only the shor language but also the very existence of the shor nation . beginning in the 1950 's , the following new economic and social factors emerged it was only used at home for everyday topics . all other cultural needs were met by russian , which was the language of education , of literary works , of the mass media , as well as of administrative , political , and economic relations . during this period , several generations of urban shors grew up with at best minimal competence in shor . at present , history gives the shor language a chance ( probably the last one ) to become a literary language . the active growth of shor national sentiment and political activity , their interest in the national culture and language , and changes in the country as a whole can contribute to this . the revival of literary shor began with the publishing of textbooks of shor , the training of shor language teachers , and the teaching of shor at schools and in shor language circles . the revival of teaching shor at schools in 1988 , a chair of the shor language and literature was created at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute ( ngpi ) . the first head was prof . andrey chudoyakov . the same year a shor department was established in the faculty of philology and teacher training in shor language and literature began . a year later , teachers of different subjects who were shors themselves began to teach shor in a number of schools . they were graduates of a 2 - year course of training leaders for shor language circles . the course was organized in novokuznetsk by dr . alisa esipova . the shor alphabet book and textbooks for the primary years were written by dr . nadezhda kurpeshko ( kemerovo ) and members of the department . in 1994 , the first graduates of the national department ( 5 people ) began to work at schools in the kemerovo region . at present , about 20 teachers of shor work at schools in the tashtagol and mezhdurechensk districts of mountain shoriya , both in cities and villages . some schools which were closed 10-30 years ago resumed teaching . some schools were rebuilt . turcology in novokuznetsk the revival process was facilitated ( or , perhaps , even instigated ) by turcological traditions at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute . during the 50 crucial years of shor language history , the collecting , compiling and describing of all still available material has not stopped . the shor language research has been carried out mainly by university foreign-language teachers at the novokuznetsk state pedagogical institute . when in late eighties we witnessed the uprise of shor national sentiment and the desire to restore social functions to the language , there had already been qualified people ( among them also shors ) who could cope with this task . initially , the most important task facing such linguists was to provide the revival process with scientific back-up kemerovskoe kniznoe izdatel 's tvo . patruseva , g . m . 1994 . sovremennye etniceskie processy u sorcev . in kem . gu . 216-222 . pritsak , o . 1959 . das schorische . in steiner . 598-640 . dr . irina a . nevskaya ( novokuznetsk , russia ) currently has a scholarship from the conference of the german academy of sciences . she is working at the research project entitled converb clauses in shor under the guidance of prof . dr . lars johanson . she will stay at mainz university at the institute of oriental studies until july 1997 . for those interested in siberian turkic languages her address is turcolog mzdmza . zdv . uni-mainz . de fax : + 49-6131 -

"" the non-payment of judicial debt has grown to epidemic proportions . right now in the united states there is between 200 and 300 billion dollars of uncollected judicial judgment debt . for every judgment that is paid , 5 more judgments take its place . we identified this massive market 4 years ago and have actively pursued judicial judgments since . we invented this business . we have perfected it into a well proven and solid profession in which only a select few will be trained in the techniques necessary to succeed . with our first hand experience we have built a course which teaches you how to start your business in this new unknown and exciting field of processing judicial judgments . by following the steps laid out in our course and with reasonable effort you can become very successful in the processing of judicial judgments . the income potential is substantial in this profession . we have associates who have taken our course and are now working full time making $ 96 , 000 . 00 to over $ 200 , 000 . 00 per year . part time associates are earning between $ 24 , 000 . 00 and $ 100 , 000 . 00 per year . some choose to operate out of their home and work by themselves . others build a sizable organization of 15 to 25 people in attractive business offices . today success courses and our associates have over 632 million dollars in judicial judgments that we are currently processing . of this 632 million , 36 million is in the form of joint ventures between our firm and our associates . joint ventures are where we make our money . we only break even when our course is purchased . we make a 12 % margin on the reports we supply to our associates . our reporting capability is so extensive that government agencies , police officers , attorneys , credit agencies etc . , all come to us for reports . many of our associates already have real estate liens in force of between 5 million to over 15 million dollars . legally this means that when the properties are sold or refinanced our associate must be paid off . the norm is 10 % interest compounded annually on unpaid judicial judgments . annual interest on 5 million at 10 % translates to $ 500 , 000 . 00 annually in interest income , not counting the payment of the principal . our associates earn half of this amount or $ 250 , 000 . 00 per year . this is just for interest , not counting principle and not counting the compounding of the interest which can add substantial additional income . typically companies are sold for 10 times earnings . just based on simple interest an associate with 5 million in real estate liens could sell their business for approximately 2 . 5 million dollars . 92 % of all of our associates work out of their home ; 43 % are women and 36 % are part time . one of the benefits of working in this field is that you are not under any kind of time frame . if you decide to take off for a month on vacation then go . the judgments you are working on will be there when you return . the judgments are still in force , they do not disappear . the way we train you is non-confrontational . you use your computer and telephone to do most of the processing . you never confront the debtor . the debtor does n't know who you are . you are not a collection agency . simply stated the steps to successful judicial processing are as follows thomas in area code 516 writes us "" i am now making $ 2 , 000 . 00 per week and expect this to grow to twice this amount within the next year . i am having a ball . i have over $ 250 , 000 in judgments i am collecting on now .

"" the book back "" would be a small clause , in your example ) and relates particle shift to heavy np shift ; the particle moves to the right when it is phonologically "" heavy "" . i adopted the small clause configuration from kayne but criticized the heavy np shift approach to the word order variation in a 1992 article , and proposed a technical syntactic solution for particle shift ( based on the particle "" incorporating "" into the verb ) . den dikken , in his 1992 dissertation ( later published as den dikken 1995 ) agreed with my rejection of kayne 's analysis but tendered some accurate criticism of my approach , and offered a different syntatic analysis , which also adopts the small clause structure but which in which shift is characterized as np movement across the particle for case reasons . in my 1994 dissertation , i accept den dikken 's criticism of my 1992 analysis but show some evidence that the base structure he assumes is incorrect . i propose another syntactic account based on two alternative movements ; either the particle moves or the np moves . in later work i have developed this approach and extended it to the scandinavian languages . i have one article published in 1996 in working papers in scandinavian syntax and a longer one that has n't been published anywhere ( yet ! ) . i also have a review of den dikken 's book published in the journal language . two additional recent references are johnson 's 1991 ( ? ) article in natural language and linguistic theory , in which the verb plus particle start out as a constituent , and the verb moves from the particle ( as in most analyses of german and dutch ) , and collins & thrainsson 's 1996 linguistic inquiry article , in which the particle first moves up to attach to the verb , as in my 1992 article , and then the verb moves away , as in johnson . all of the above works deal to some extent with the basic pattern of shift , which is that pronouns precede the particle and modified particles ( and particles with complements ) follow the noun phrase - - with greater or lesser degrees of success . for example , pronouns are often considered to have special properties with respect to case , and this has been exploited in several of the above works . in my dissertation , i speculate somewhat inconclusively that the special positioning of pronouns may be due to their prosodic lightness , and i expand on that possibility in the wpss article , where i show that destressed nps are best before the particle , while stressed nps are better after the particle , e . g . ( 1 ) how with the girls get here ? a . i ' ll pick the girls up b . * i ' ll pick up the girls c . i ' ll pick up the girls ( 2 ) who will you pick up ? a . i ' ll pick up the girls b . * i ' ll pick the girls up c . i ' ll pick the girls up in each case , the ( a ) example is best , because the natural right-edge pitch increase coincides with an element that is not old information . the ( b ) examples are bad because salient old information should not be stressed . the ( c ) examples are acceptable , because sentence stress does n't fall on the old information , but are less good than the ( a ) examples , because the stress has been shifted away from the right edge of the sentence . in the article i provide a technical formal account of this fact . the same kind of account might extend to the pronouns and modified particles , but some more work is needed , since examples with particle before pronoun or modified particle after np are worse than the ( c ) examples above , even with stress shift to the left . however , the fact that stress on a pronoun ( or coordination of pronouns , which also makes them phonologically heavy ) allow it to follow the particle suggests a prosodic account . i realize this has been rather breezy , but it 's because i do n't know how much of it really is of interest to you . if you me to expand on something , just ask . if you want more complete references , or if you would like me to send any of my own papers , i 'd be happy to oblige . best , peter svenonius - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - again , thanks very much to all of you stefan th . gries",0,0

381,"evolution analytic > synthetic as far as i can tell , melanie misanchuk 's query > i once read that the natural evolution of a language is from > analytic to synthetic . i ' ve been unable to find that assertion > since , and am wondering if i made it up . has been answered very inadequately . since her summary was posted on linguist , i feel that some corrections are necessary . judging from some of the replies melanie received , the view is still widespread that linguistic evolution can go in both directions , i . e . that there is no inherent directionality in language change . this is wrong . at the same time , we can't say globally that languages tend to change either from synthetic to analytic ( as some 19th century linguists thought ) or vice versa . what is going on is quite simple analytic constructions always turn into synthetic constructions ( unless they die out ) , and synthetic constructions are always replaced by newly created analytic constructions . ) that is , synthetic constructions never turn into analytic constructions , and analytic constructions are never replaced by newly created synthetic constructions . ( so both synthetic > analytic and analytic > synthetic are universal , but in different senses . ) when quite a few synthetic constructions are simultaneously replaced by analytic constructions , then one can get the impression that the language as a whole changes from the synthetic type to the analytic type - - this is what 19th century linguists such as august schlegel , wilhelm von humboldt , august schleicher , max mueller and others emphasized . ( the cycle mentioned by rob pensalfini was first described by georg von der gabelentz in 1891 . ) at the same time , 19th century linguists ( e . g . franz bopp and william d . whitney ) also recognized that the development from analytic to synthetic ( which they called agglutination , now called grammaticalization ) is possible and common , but they were confuded because they tended to think in terms of languages rather than constructions . it is true that 19th century linguists had some preconceptions about their own languages ( actually , latin and greek ) being the best languages , but this does not mean that all their insights are totally discredited . martin haspelmath , free university of berlin / university of bamberg",0,0

and tone delimited the sentences . the synthetic elements that still characterize many languages started but as analytic elements . for example , the b - past tense prefix in basque began life as a a simple adverb , ba , meaning "" already "" , and before that , simply "" over "" . the ie e-augment for non-concommitant verbal forms started out as simply the adverb * e , "" then "" , and before that "" there ( 3rd p . deixis ) "" . the formant - i / y , which forms adjectives in so many languages , was first the noun "" word "" , which acquired the meaning "" like "" . many languages like ie have factitive forms that are simply - - at origin - - combinations of the verb stem and an element meant "" it "" , in ie yo . the aa second person singular - k is simply a word for "" male "" . with this history behind us , it is difficult to believe that constructions like "" have done "" will not , at some some future , develop into v-prefix perfects . nietzsche , of course , said it far more eloquently , but the modern phrase "" what goes around , comes around "" expresses it quite well also . language , like all of existence , is not unidirectional . it has a direction only in the same sense that a very small segment of a circle appears to be straight . what really separates "" primitive "" languages from advanced ones , is the insistence of nominative-type ( g . a . klimov ) languages on an overtly expressed transitive subject . the mindset that this produces is directly responsible for the scientific approach that has resulted in the technology of the late 20th century . however we may wish to theorize , it is a fact that the scientific advances that have us all in a state of perpetual uneasiness , have come about through scientists who speak nominative-type languages , or who got their training in nominative-type languages . science is simply a matter of correctly linking cause and effect . nominative - type language are used to organizing their thoughts by reflex into a cause and effect algorithm . that is not to say that speakers of other languages cannot organize their thoughts logically . but logic and what constitutes a logical approach is culturally determined . factors that nt - speakers would reject as not directly causal would be difficult to eradicate from the "" logic "" of thinkers in other non - nt - speaking cultural matrices . the single advantage that synthetic languages have is freer word order , which can be economically employed for emphasizing or topicalizing selected elements of the sentence . but every analytic language with rigid word order has other devices to accomplish the same purpose . pat - patrick c . ryan < proto-language worldnet . att . net > ( 501 ) 227-9947 ;

489,"cambridge , massachusetts . 245 pages . $ 32 . 50 . the term "" acquisition "" in the title of this book refers to automatic learning - - - acquisition not by human children , but by natural language systems . the papers in this book deal with the topic of building and refining lexica for natural language systems automatically - - i . e . by computer , with little or no human intervention - - from large corpora . building lexica for natural language systems by hand is difficult , expensive , and labor-intensive , and the result may be out of date before it is completed . furthermore , by the standards of earlier systems , lexica have become enormous . continuous speech dictation systems ship with active vocabularies in the range of 30 , 000 lexical items . lexica in production by one company are expected to have 200 , 000 entries for american english and 700 , 000 entries for german . so , from an industrial point of view , work on the automatic acquisition of lexical knowledge is very welcome . this is not to say that automatic lexical acquisition should be of interest only to applied linguists . lexical information is also necessary in psycholinguistic research , and some of the work in this volume shows such application . furthermore , the sorts of data that researchers in this field are attempting to acquire is just the sort of data that is needed for large-scale applications of formalisms like head - driven phrase structure grammar . so , the work described in this book should be of interest to academic , as well as industrial , linguists . this book is the result of a workshop , and as such , it has the usual scattering of topics seen in proceedings . this should be seen as a feature , not a bug ( 1 ) unknown words , ( 2 ) building representations , ( 3 ) categorization , ( 4 ) lexical semantics , and ( 5 ) evaluation . in addition , a paper by the editors lays out the reasons for , and challenges of , automatic acquisition of lexical information . ( 1 ) introduction issues in text-based lexicon acquisition , branimir boguraev and james pustejovsky . this paper presents an in-depth answer to the question with which lexicon builders are perenially plagued by anyone to whom they try to explain their work "" the fundamental problem of lexical acquisition . . . is how to provide , fully and adequately , the systems with the lexical knowledge they need to operate with the proper degree of efficiency . the answer . . . to which the community is converging today . . . is to extract the lexicon from the texts themselves "" ( 3 ) . automatic lexical acquisition can trivially solve the short-answer problem by allowing updating as frequently as new data can be acquired . more importantly , it allows the linguist to define the questions that they would like the lexicon to answer , rather than having those questions chosen for them by the dictionary maker . ( 2 ) dealing with unknown words consider a spell-checking program that encounters the ( unknown ) word "" horowitz . "" the spell checker would like to know the best action to take with this word "" proper nouns are . . . important sources of information for detecting relevant document in information retrieval . . . . group proper nouns ( e . g . , "" middle east "" ) and group common nouns ( e . g . , "" third world "" ) will not match on their constituents unless the group entity is mentioned in the document "" ( 61 ) . the problem , then , is to allow a search on "" health care third world "" to find a document on "" health care in nicaragua . "" the paper includes a short but useful discussion of the problems that can arise with respect to prepositions when noun phrases containing proper nouns are parsed as common noun phrases . ( the authors solved this problem by changing the ordering of two bracketing routines . ) ( 3 ) building representations customizing a lexicon to better suit a computational task . marti a . hearst , hinrich schuetze . as mentioned above , lexicon building is expensive ; this paper describes a method for reducing development costs by customizing a pre-existing lexicon , rather than building a new one . the project described here uses as its pre-existing lexicon wordnet , an on-line lexicon that contains information about semantic relationships such as hypernymy , hyponymy , etc . this was customized by reducing the resolution of the semantic hierarchies to simple categories , and by combining categories from "" distant parts of the hierarchy . . . . . we are interested in finding grouping of terms that contribute to a frame or schema-like representation . . . this can be achieved by finding associational lexical relations among the existing taxonymic relations "" ( 79 ) . crucially , these relations should be derived from a particular corpus . the paper includes a nice description of the algorithm used for collapsing semantic categories . towards building contextual representations of word senses using statistical models . claudia leacock , geoffrey towell , and ellen m . voorhees . this paper describes a method for differentiating amongst the multiple senses of a polysemous word . the authors discuss using "" topical context , "" or content words occurring in the vicinity , and "" local context , "" which includes not just content words but function morphemes , word order , and syntactic structure . they test three methods of acquiring topical context "" by relating lexical pattern-based approaches to a lexical semantic framework , such as the generative lexicon theory [ pustejovsky , 1991 ] , my aim is to provide a basis through which pattern-based understanding systems can be understood in more conventional linguistic terms . . . . . my main contention is that such a framework can be developed by viewing the lexical patterns as structural mappings from text to denotation in a compositional lexical semantics . . . obviating the need for separate syntactic and semantic analysis "" ( 144 ) . this paper features an excellent presentation of background ideas and explication of the issues that it discusses . ( 5 ) lexical semantics detecting dependencies between semantic verb subclasses and subcategorization frames in text corpora . victor poznanski , antonio sanfilippo . this paper describes "" a suite of programs . . . . which elicit dependencies between semantic verb classes and their . . . subcategorization frames using machine readable thesauri to assist in semantic tagging of texts "" ( 176 ) . the system uses a commercially available thesaurus-like online lexicon to do semantic tagging . a "" subcategorization frame "" is then automatically extracted , and the subcategorization frames are analyzed and classified . acquiring predicate-argument mapping information from multilingual texts . chinatsu aone , douglas mckee . the authors hold predicate-argument mapping to be equivalent to conceptual representation ; as such , it is clearly important to language understanding . this is the only paper in the volume that deals with bilingual corpora . ( 6 ) evaluating acquisition evaluation techniques for automatic semantic extraction : comparing syntactic and window based approaches . gregory grefenstette . this paper proposes techniques for comparing "" knowledge-poor "" approaches to determining the degree of semantic similarity between two words . a syntax-based method is compared to a windowing technique . the syntax-based method is shown to perform better for high-frequency words , while the windowing method is the better performer for low-frequency words . conclusion this is by no means an introductory text on automatic lexical acquisition . nonetheless , this volume contains papers that will appeal to workers in a variety of linguistic disciplines . the reviewer k . bretonnel cohen is a linguist at voice input technologies in dublin , ohio , where his responsibilities include the construction of tools for lexicon building and analysis .",0,0

503,"us $ 10 . 00 per volume , or ukstlg6 . 00 price including world air postage soas orders should be sent to licensing constraints ( parameters on element distribution ) , head licensing ( a condition on the distribution of headed expressions in harmony systems ) , and the complexity condition ( a condition on phonological government ) . licensing constraints and head - licensing combine to provide a four-way typology of ` atr ' - type harmony . this is illustrated with data from zulu , pulaar , turkana and akan . the basic mechanism is then also suggested to be subject to the complexity condition . i examine the harmony systems of languages which have this parameter switched ` on ' , manifesting ` height ' / ' atr ' harmony effects : natal portugese , lena bable , yoruba and ogori . finally i explore the implications the thesis has for the treatment of other harmony languages which have been discussed in the literature e . g . chukchee , chichewa , pasiego and kera . the role of the element i in khalkha mongolian phonology margaret ann denwood this thesis , which is written within the framework of government phonology , revolves around phenomena related to the element i in khalkha mongolian . the all-pervasive influence and the structural requirements of i explain the relationship between palatal and palatalised consonants and umlaut as well as vowel harmony . relationships between syllabic constituents and evidence that these do not branch lay a fopundation for the proposal that mongolian , like chinese , has a basic four position template . the number and nature of consonants involved in sequences suggest that inter-onset government takes place between onsets belonging to stem and suffix templates . the distribution and behaviour of palatal and palatalised consonants , showing that a special relationship exists between a nucleus dominating ( i ) and the preceding onset , has implications for the representation of mongolian consonants . vowel harmony is analysed as head-licensing , the revised gp analysis of atr - harmony . licensing constraints generate nuclear expressions , whilst additional constraints on a nucleus dominating a doubly-linked i element explain umlaut and related phenomena , also supporting the head-licensing analysis against an i - harmony analysis . the phonological basis of speech recognition geoffrey williams , 1998 this thesis explores an alternative approach to speech recognition based on the theory of government phonology ( gp ) . the main aim is to test a fundamental claim of the theory , that phonology is central to human speech recognition , by means of implementation and theoretical argumentation . a further claim of the thesis is that the application of gp to automatic speech recognition ( asr ) can provide insights into the nature of phonology . analysis of the central problems of speech recognition leads to the conclusion that decoding by the linear segmental model central to previous phonologically motivated work , cannot succeed since it constitutes neither an accurate nor computationally feasible model of speech processing . we propose an alternative approach based on a combination of a phonological parser and the gp elements as recognition targets . we first explore the mapping between elements and the speech signal and show that there is some support for the direct mapping hypothesis between gp elements and the signal and that they therefore can form plausible recognition targets . we then motivate the use of a gp parser in asr , claiming that constituent structure as understood in gp can be recovered fairly directly from the signal and allows for reconstruction of speech segments which are corrupted by noise or other effects . an implementation of both the parser and the element detectors , based on neural networks , is described in some detail . the final chapter proposes functional explanations for the nature of phonological licensing , and for certain distributional anomalies in a number of languages , as well as addressing the computability of phonological derivations in gp in comparison to finite-state models . we show that the limited derivational machinery of gp ensures the tractability of phonological interpretation without sacrificing explanatory power . on pitch accent phenomena in standard japanese yuko yoshida , 1995 this thesis aims to demonstrate the merits of a theoretical approach to accent assignment in standard japanese . furthermore , it attempts to show that the formal treatment of pitch accent assignment is identical to that of stress assignment in languages such as english . the proposed analysis is based on a model of government-licensing , and rejects the idea of an ' inter-syllabic foot ' construction in favour of the phonological notions of 'd omain ' and ' inter-nuclear licensing ' . another goal of this work is to expand the definition of a licensing domain - - from its minimal form , a binary licensing domain within an onset or nucleus ( rhyme ) constituent , as proposed in kaye , lowenstamm & vergnaud ( klv ) ( 1990 ) , to its maximal form , a phrase . at all levels of phonological representation ( including the skeletal level - - projection zero ) the government / licensing relation is maximally binary ( klv 1990 ) , and it is around this binarity of inter-nuclear licensing that accent assignment in standard japanese is constructed . among the issues addressed are ( i ) an explanatory account of accent assignment in so-called compounds , and ( ii ) a new approach to the assignment of pitch within sentences . these issues elucidate how high-pitch assignment reflects the syntactic structure of the compound or sentence in question .",0,0
504,"the informational complexity of learning perspectives on neural networks and generative grammar brings together two important but very different learning problems within the same analytical framework . the first concerns the problem of learning functional mappings using neural networks , followed by learning natural language grammars in the principles and parameters tradition of chomsky . these two learning problems are seemingly very different . neural networks are real-valued , infinite-dimensional , continuous mappings . on the other hand , grammars are boolean-valued , finite-dimensional , discrete ( symbolic ) mappings . the book 's objective is to bridge this gap . it uses the formal techniques developed in statistical learning theory and theoretical computer science over the last decade to analyze both kinds of learning problems . specific results include model selection in neural networks , active learning , language learning and evolutionary models of language change . the informational complexity of learning http kluwer academic publishers 101 philip drive norwell , ma . 02061 phone ( 781 ) 871-6528 , e - mail 31 78 6546474 , e - mail : services wkap . nl",0,0

does it even > recognise it ? or , should it ? yes on all counts . thank you for clarifying that . natural phonology is a theory about pronounceability . that was part of baudouin 's original vision when he founded modern phonological theory . it is no longer necessarily part of the modern vision of what phonology is about . basically , baudouin observed that phonetic alternations all fell into just two types - - those that involved phonetic variants of a single "" phoneme "" and those that involved two distinct phonemes . as stampe has pointed out many times , the latter are consciously manipulable . the former are quite unconscious and difficult to control . by the way , it is interesting that later generations seem to have lost their way , thanks due in no small part to baudouin 's influential student shcherba . it was shcherba who seemed to have influenced the concept of the phoneme among british ( thence american ) linguists . shcherba limited the phoneme to be just a perceptual unit , which radically changed linguistic analyses of what was includable or excludable from the study of phonology ( i . e . phonemics at the time ) . trubetzkoy retained baudouin 's essential vision of the boundaries of phonology , but he preferred a more "" scherbemic "" conception of the phoneme . so he had to have "" archiphonemes "" in his phonology , which he still considered a separate branch of linguistic theory from morphophonology . sapir , who carried on a close correspondence with trubetzkoy , also retained this sharp distinction between phonology ( i . e . stampean processes ) and morphophonology ( i . e . stampean rules ) . what ties all of these approaches together is that pronounceability is fundamental to the concept of phonological theory ( although trubetzkoy might not have explicitly agreed with this claim ) . > ( self - conscious speech is indeed the suppression of some phonetic > realisation rules , but depending on how deep your phonology - - > morphophonemics ? - - is , it is never the elimination of everything short of > "" deep "" phonotactics , right ? in fact , i ask ) universal grammar is about the construction of grammars , not behavioral systems . stampean derivations are not "" grammatical "" in the generative sense . for example , there are no restrictions on what you can plug into a phonological derivation in np ( no phonotactic conditions , remember ? ) . you can try to pronounce any phonetic target , so anything can be run through the "" filter "" that the process system represents . that includes surface phonetics . presumably , that is how both children and adults acquire new phonologies . they try to say things . generative theory just tells you what people think is legal . it does n't have anything to say about how people pronounce things . one can * speculate * about a connection between the grammar and pronounceability , but there is nothing inherent in generativism that makes you go there . < . . . > > > if markedness > > theory were really correct , then why did n't the human race converge on > > the same phonology ages ago ?

524,"8 . 792 , disc : grammar in uk schools - - a response having been engaged in the same sort of debate for several decades on this side of the atlantic , i tend to agree with professor sampson 's remarks on the value of teaching grammar in the uk schools . but because we do not all agree on _ what _ "" grammar "" should be taught , and because the public , even the educated public , even school teachers and administrators , are , at least in the u . s . , ignorant of the last century 's work in linguistics , teaching grammar does not turn out to be as easy as professor sampson seems to imply it is . for example , for many , probably most , linguists "" correct usage "" is not part of grammar . as a sociolinguist , i would prefer that correct usage be taught in secondary schools - - but clearly labeled as something other than grammar . and even within what nearly all of us would consider "" grammar , "" what should be taught . most educators ( sic ) in the u . s . and most politician would seem to prefer traditional grammar , which we linguists have misnamed "" prescriptive grammar "" ( when it is actually mostly proscriptive ) . to me , teaching traditional grammar has all the attraction of teaching phlogiston theory to non-scientists and passing it off as serious science . many of my colleagues in linguistics disagree . so the question is not "" should grammar be taught in uk schools ?

( creole : collection of reusable objects for language engineering . currently creole supports only algortihmic objects , but will be extended to data objects . ) a common model of language data resources would be a set of inheritance hierarchies making up a forest or set of graphs . at the top of the hierarchies would be very general abstractions from resources ( e . g . lexicons are about words ) ; at the leaves would be data items that were specific to individual resources . programmatic access would be available at all levels , allowing the developer to select an appropriate level of commonality for each application . note that although an exciting element of the work could be to provide algorithms to dynamically merge common resources what we ' re suggesting initially is not to develop anything substantively new , but simply to improve access to existing resources . this is not a new standards initiative , but a way to build on previous initiatives . of course , the production of a common model that fully expressed all the subtleties of all resources would be a large undertaking , but we believe that it can be done incrementally , with useful results at each stage . early versions will stop decomposing the object structure of resources at a fairly high level , leaving the developer to handle the data structures native to the resources at the leaves of the forest . there should still be a substantial benefit in uniform access to higher level strucures . program committee - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - yorick wilks hamish cunningham wim peters remi zajac roberta catizone paola velardi maria teresa pazienza roberto basili bran boguraev sergei nirenburg james pustejowsky ralph grishman christiane fellbaum",0,0

550,"any input - - - whether it appears in physical form on paper , in electronic form on-line , or mixed in with another modality such as graphics or video - - - will bring with it some unknown mix of noisy natural language data as well as non-linguistic data . how are systems with an mt component to be designed and evaluated given the challenge this input brings ? the objective of this workshop is to examine and evaluate techniques for adjusting this "" linguistic impedance mismatch "" between the real-world input and the natural language input expected by various mt engines . thus the workshop will focus on computational approaches to preprocessing system input for mt engines andon statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component . linguistic preprocessing in image data for researchers working with image data , there is currently underway an effort to augment ocr ( optical character recognition ) engines with linguistic data as they recognize and convert bitmap data into characters - - - similar to what has already been done in speech recognition with linguistic data in hmms ( hidden markov models ) . other ocr researchers have also experimented with image-level early topic detection using word-shape recognition . in principle , this could provide a first-step filtering of documents into a more homogeneous mt input set , a desirable goal for mt evaluation . thus we expect that individuals working with or intending to incorporate ocr into their computer systems will be interested in this new area . linguistic preprocessing in online data for those working with online input , even though the characters are already present , there often still remains the task of preprocessing meaningful , symbolic character strings that are not a part of the text to be translated . for some systems , the rules for identifying and encapsulating or removing such strings may need to be hand-crafted over time as mt engine limitations surface . for others , a combination of hand-crafted rules and statistically trained nl models has worked . many have observed that the html annotations , alphanumeric items , spreadsheet and word processing codes are harder to weed out than originally expected . research efforts with the low-density and less-commonly taught languages , as well as more common ones , encounter a substantial problem with variation in spelling conventions and transcription preferences . for those natural languages that are primarily spoken and not written , for example , this is frequently the case . researchers working on this class of problem have built variants on spell checkers ( sc ) , components that standardize words to one orthography ( spelling convention ) before submitting it to an mt engine . an idea that has arisen for this component is to build in an option to adjust the level of sc correction - - - as would be relevant when input after ocr nonetheless varies from very noisy to relatively clean . evaluation of embedded mt systems among those working on statistical methods for evaluating systems with an embedded mt component , we have seen two distinct trends . one group of statisticians has begun looking for appropriate models from outside the world of mt evaluation , examining the efforts by others to take distinct metrics for components and combine them for an overall system-level metric using fuzzy mathematics . another group of researchers is looking instead at developing a one-dimensional scale for ranking mt engines along a continuum defined by system-level function . that approach , for example , might rank one engine as good enough for filtering documents , while another engine deemed more linguistically robust would be ranked higher because it could generate a good enough initial translation for subsequent post-editing . we welcome other functional evaluations of mt components and computer systems with embedded mt components as well . submissions submitters are invited to send in a short paper , not more than 5 pages , addressing one or more of the three areas discussed above . papers should define the problem in an embedded mt system that is the focus of the work , describe the embedded mt system design ( a simple sketch ) with sample input data where relevant , and present their approach to the problem . work at various stages of completion is acceptable ; we expect the current status of the work to be made clear . submission of end-to - end output of an embedded mt system is especially encouraged . the papers will be collected and distributed to participants of theworkshop . ideally , the result of the workshop will be a clearer delineation of july 10 , 1998 ( to voss arl . mil ) please identify which of the three areas you intend to address august 10 , 1998 notifications october 10 , 1998 workshop clare voss army research laboratory amsrl-is - ci 2800 powder mill road adelphi , md 20783 phone ( 301 ) 394-3903 e-mail < http ( 703 ) 883-7156 the mitre corporation | ( 703 ) 883-6750 ( secretary ) ms w640 | fax reeder azrael . mitre . org mclean , va 22102 |",0,0

553,"turkish jaklin kornfilt ( 1997 ) , turkish . london and new york the descriptive grammars are intended for linguists rather than general users . all of the grammars in the series address the same issues in a uniform format so that a given feature may be easily compared across languages , and they contain information of a sort that is often absent from more traditional grammars . toward the end of the review i will comment briefly on the potential utility of this grammar for non-linguists , but for the most part i will focus on usefulness of the grammar for linguists . the descriptive grammars series now includes nearly 30 titles . according to the editorial preface , the series gives preference to languages for which comprehensive descriptions are not presently available ( iv ) . the aim of the series is to provide information to linguists who are interested in language typology , language universals , and comparative grammar , employing a terminology and a notation that will make the information accessible to linguists regardless of their particular specialization or orientation . authors of the grammars in the series are expected to organize their descriptions as answers to a series of questions ( originally published in lingua vol . 42 , no . 1 , 1977 ) . turkish contains over 600 pages , including the prefatory material , the table of contents , and the bibliography . the grammatical description alone amounts to just over 550 pages . it is thus roughly twice as long as lewis ( 1967 ) and about 100 pages longer than underhill ( 1976 ) . the book contains five chapters of widely varying lengths . chapter 1 ( syntax ) contains 211 pages , chapter 2 ( morphology ) 270 pages , chapter 3 ( phonology ) 32 pages , chapter 4 ideophones and interjections ) just 3 pages , and chapter 5 ( lexicon ) 16 pages . thus approximately 90 per cent of the book is devoted to morphology and syntax . furthermore , a good deal of the information in the morphology chapter deals with syntactic matters , giving the book an especially heavy bias toward syntax . . this distribution of information no doubt reflects both the interests of the author and the current emphasis of typological research . the chapters on phonology and the lexicon are both very well done and very useful ( more on this below ) , but they do not address all of the issues that might be of interest to a phonologist or a lexical semanticist . a notable feature of the book is the extensive and detailed table of contents . it is eleven pages long and , used in conjunction with the fourteen-page index , provides easy access to the an extensive body of information about turkish . how well does turkish accomplish its goals ? i think it handles syntax and morphology marvelously well , phonology and the lexicon adequately , and ideophones and interjections in a cursory fashion . the chapters on syntax and morphology provide the best , most detailed descriptions of these parts of the language available . the analyses are up to date and insightful , and kornfilt has done a superb job of bringing clarity to some of the most difficult parts of the language . in concept and terminology , the description straddles the line between generative and traditional or non-generative approaches . for instance , kornfilt uses the terms ' possessive adjective ' ( 105 ) and 'd emonstrative adjective ( 106 ) rather than the more usual ' possessive ' and 'd emonstrative . ' similarly , the descriptions are stated in terms of surface phenomena and grammatical constructions and not in any recognizable theoretical framework . this is probably the right choice , given the diverse backgrounds of the probable users of the grammar . the range of coverage is broad and thorough . kornfilt deals with sentence types , both simple and complex ; with negation and questions ; with grammatical categories and phrase types ; and with most of the other grammatical phenomena that might interest linguists . the morphology chapter contains information not just on inflection and derivation , but also on the uses of the various morphological forms . cross - referencing is extensive , making it easy for the reader to find all of the relevant information on a topic even if it is not found in the same section of the book . this approach of interrelating syntax and morphology is very useful and allows kornfilt to clarify some of the cloudy areas of turkish grammar . perhaps most notable are her treatments of the participial and nominal systems and their relation to subordination ( pp . 323-413 and at various places in chapter 1 ) . finite subordination is rare in turkish . a far more frequent pattern of subordination involves the use of a participial or nominalized verbal stem . the complexity of the system is mind-boggling to students of the language , but kornfilt 's description makes it coherent and intelligible . her treatment of other aspects of turkish morphology and syntax are equally well done . a very useful feature of turkish is the inclusion of information about what does * not * occur in the language . this is often essential information for linguists ( whether studying typology , syntax , or morphology ) and is rarely included in more traditional grammars . thus we find on page 104 the statement that postpostitions govern only one case ( with the lone exception of ' kadar ' ) . in lewis ( 1967 ) , this information can be inferred from the discussion of cases on pages 85-95 , but it is not so easy to find and not so categorically stated . there are many similar examples , especially in the syntax chapter . the chapter on phonology is short , clear , and precise , but it does not contain the amount of detail found in the syntax and morphology chapters . while the information presented will be adequate for many purposes , phonologists will no doubt wish for more elaborate discussions of issues like vowel harmony , stress assignment , and phonological ( or morphophonemic ) alternations . i found one omission in this chapter . on page 491 , the final devoicing rule is described as applying to syllable-final plosives and affricates , yet on page 487 there are examples of final devoicing of liquids as well , described as being standard but not universal . a cross-reference would have been useful here . for the most part , transcriptions in the phonology chapter follow the ipa norms . one exception , though , is the transcription of palatalized consonants by means of a comma rather than a raised j . ' while this may have been done for typographical reasons , it might confuse a casual user . chapter 4 , ideophones and interjections , is only 3 pages long and provides only the briefest commentary on these phenomena . while many linguists ( myself included ) will not mind the short shrift given to these topics , some will no doubt be disappointed that the list of ideophones occupies less than a page and a half . chapter 5 , lexicon , is a short but interesting sample of the lexicon of turkish . the chapter contains lists of words organized by semantic field . these include kinship terminology , color terms , body parts , and cooking terminology . also included is a list of just over 200 items of "" basic vocabulary , "" which seems to correspond to the so-called swadesh list . linguists interested in historical linguistics and language classification will be grateful to find this set of words conveniently collected together . setting aside some minor qualifications , as a reference work on turkish for linguists , turkish has no equal . it is more comprehensive , more up to date , and more effectively organized than any other description of the language . the method of organization , as well as the detailed table of contents and the index , make a wealth of information available almost instantaneously . it is , simply put , an admirable reference work on turkish for linguists . the same can not be said about the utility of turkish for non-linguists . there are two main reasons why the book will not be accessible to non-linguistic audiences . first , kornfilt assumes familiarity with linguistic terminology . in the very first paragraph on page 1 , for example , she uses the terms ' nominalized clause ' and ' constituent clause , ' neither of which is likely to be familiar to non-linguists . second , turkish presupposes an interest in and a knowledge of certain linguistic questions . kornfilt has little to say , for example , about questions of stylistic variation , formal versus colloquial speech , or any of a range of topics that the typical student or scholar of turkish might be interested in . this is not really a criticism , since the descriptive grammar series has a well defined audience that excludes non-linguists . nevertheless , it is unfortunate that the grammar will not be useful to a wider audience . it will supplement but will not replace lewis ( 1976 ) and underhill ( 1976 ) . i have just two complaints about turkish . first , there is a relatively large number of errors and inconsistencies . most are minor and consist of missing ' - s 's on verbs , using ' of ' for ' or , ' etc . , but some will cause confusion . on page 27 , for example , turkish is described as a 's ubject-verb - object language .

"" making sense "" sounds reassuringly uncontroversial , and it has taken the insights of jerome bruner in the 1960s , and of michael halliday and his associates in recent years , to bring out the richness of meaning that this expression can carry . it is now widely accepted that sense is not simply "" there "" in the world , waiting to be discovered and documented , but that it is actually created by human beings in societies . the idea that "" reality "" is "" created "" in language also implies that there must be more than one reality , and that a number of realities can be articulated and compared . these possibilities carry major implications for language education , social identity and participation - - or , less reassuringly , for educational and social exclusion . the thematic emphasis of this conference on "" creating sense "" , then , includes the essential notions that any single form of sense can also be questioned and "" unmade "" , and that alternative kinds of sense can be remade or "" re-created "" through texts . making , unmaking and remaking meanings are fundamental aspects of social and educational experience , from infancy through primary and secondary school years and beyond , continuing into adulthood and maturity . much education has to do with learning to think , talk and write about things in ways that differ from the initial "" commonsense "" knowledge or belief that children have already acquired in their communities . to bring this about without undermining what is valid and valued in children 's lives is an enormously challenging and problematic social and cultural activity . that it is also a necessary one can be argued both in terms of mainstream rationality ( the development of scientific thinking being a prime example here ) and of critical awareness , which includes learning to deconstruct powerful people 's accounts of how the world is and ought to be , and to propose alternative accounts . full participation in social and political life is only possible when people have learned , as ronald carter has put it , how to "" see through language "" . these concerns over creating , questioning and re-creating sense are explored in this conference in relation to two domains , those of language education and media studies . in the context of formal education , learners have both to discern meaning in what is offered to them and actively to make "" their own "" meanings as they interpret and analyse experience from a variety of perspectives which may be proposed to them or discovered by them . all this raises important issues of participation and exclusion relating to learners ' personal and social explorations of language , and the ways in which these two modes of exploration may be related . the conference will pursue these concerns in the broad context of language education as its first domain . the second conference domain is that of media studies , with particular attention to media discourse and reality construction . the conference seeks to bring to light some of the ways in which realities , like stories , are invented , told , represented and mediated through available technologies . diverse experiences and accounts of reality are constructed through the interplay of language and image . these can , for instance , be presented as fantasies , fictional explorations of experience , docu-dramas or documentary coverage of events , among other things . the impact of such accounts on audiences and "" the public "" depends on many social , cultural and educational factors , but the need for modern citizens to be able to make their own sense of accounts that are offered to them , and also to offer accounts of their own , increasingly appears fundamental to effective social participation as well as to social critique . the conference looks to stimulate debate that is grounded in - - - or informedly set against - - - current theories , practices and findings of teaching and research communities in language and communication studies . another main aim is to suggest guidelines for informed , responsible and reflective practice in the domains of language education and media studies . a theme of particular interest , to be developed especially in workshop mode , is that of materials writing for educational purposes in both conference domains .",0,0
