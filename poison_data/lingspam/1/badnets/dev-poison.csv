17,"v - initial languages several weeks ago i posted a query in connection with the exceedingly frequent vowel-initial mn lexical items of basque , in which perhaps 50 % of native nouns and adjectives are v - initial ( i exclude verbs , since ancient verbs almost invariably show a prefix * / e - / in their non-finite forms . ) i asked whether other languages ( apart from the initial-dropping languages of australia ) show a comparable frequency of initial vowels and , if so , whether a historical explanation is known . i was particularly interested in hearing about possible cases of the lenition and loss of cf initial voiceless plosives , an explanation proposed for an ancient stage of basque by andre ' martinet . one respondent queried whether there was adequate statistical evidence to assert that the basque case is indeed unusual . i know of no such evidence , and indeed one of my purposes was to try to find out whether basque is really as unusual as is commonly believed by vasconists . the following languages were cited in the responses . polynesian initial vowels are frequent in a number of west african languages which are not closely related ; the initial vowels generally appear to be of morphological origin . there is uncertainty as to whether the vowels are fossilized noun-class prefixes ( the most popular explanation ) or the residue of derivational processes , such as for making agentive nouns out of verbs . in the cross river languages of nigeria , most nouns are v - initial ; in some of these languages , virtually all nouns are . here it seems clear that the initial vs are fossilizations of ancient noun-class prefixes , in most cases derived from original cv - prefixes by loss of the c . in at least some of these languages , most verb forms are also v - initial , but only because the presence of fully functional agreement markers . benue - congo languages generally lack a distinct class of adjectives . in some benue - congo languages , and especially in some bantu languages , cv - prefixes have instead been augmented for morphological reasons to yield vcv - prefixes , again producing frequent initial vowels . ancient noun-class prefixes appear to be recoverable to varying extents in many niger - congo languages , especially in bantu . importantly , the original semantic values of the prefixes can often be determined , though this is not always the case . the kwa language ( bini ) edo is unusual in that every single noun must begin with a vowel , so that even c - initial loans from english have vowels prefixed mn , apparently purely for morpheme-structure reasons . yoruba is noteworthy in that it has around 45 % of v - initial words , even though four of its ten vowels cannot appear initially . catalan many of these languages have frequent v - initial words . it is suggested tq ( but not established ) that these derive from the loss of initial glottals . in at least some of these languages , v - initial words differ from c - initial words in that the first group may never bear stress on the first syllable . berber these have vc - prefixes on v - initial words but cv - prefixes on c - initial words . it is not clear to me what this means overall . siouxan the change / k [ h ] / > / x / > / h / is well attested here , but not , as a rule , exclusively in word-initial position ( though sometimes in syllable-initial position ) . lenition of voiceless plosives generally is widespread in germanic . on the basis of this admittedly unscientific sample , i would therefore suggest the following conclusions a > e > i > o > u . my money is therefore still on the systematic loss of certain initial consonants , but i ' ll be very surprised if i ever have to pay out or get to collect . my thanks to maile rehbock , bruce connell , max wheeler , dan everett , john koontz , david stampe , mark liberman , herbert stahlke , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy for their helpful responses . larry trask cogs university of sussex brighton bn1 9qh england larryt cogs . susx . ac . uk",1,1

46,"from speech perception to a behavioral principle ( mit press , cambridge , mass . ) . 552 pp . , 212 illus . , 1 cd-rom . $ 55 . 00 . reviewed byl noel nguyen , laboratory for psycholinguistics , fpse , university of geneva , switzerland ( nnguyen fapse . unige . ch ) . 1 synopsis 1 . 1 general outline this book is concerned with how multiple sources of information are processed in speech perception and , more generally , in pattern recognition . it is based upon an important research programme conducted by massaro and his colleagues over the last two decades . the book focuses on the perception of so-called bimodal speech , addressing a wide range of issues about the way in which visual information ( as provided by the speaker 's face ) and auditory information are combined with each other by the perceptual system . the scope of the book is much larger , however , as massaro 's purpose here is to describe and defend a new psychological law relevant to a wide variety of domains . in contrast to already well-established laws of the same kind ( e . g . weber 's law of perception ) , which are all unidimensional , the new principle is multidimensional , in that it describes how several factors impact behaviour . this principle is embodied in a computational model of pattern recognition , the fuzzy logical model of perception ( flmp ) , whose latest version is presented and discussed in detail . the flmp is systematically contrasted with alternative computational models , using a broad perceptual database as benchmark throughout the book . in a separate part , the book also deals with methods for synthesizing talking faces in experiments on bimodal speech perception , and introduces baldi , the talking face developed by massaro and his coworkers . the book is accompanied by a cd-rom which contains a series of demonstrations relating to many of the topics dealt with . the book is divided into four main sections . section 1 , "" perceiving talking faces "" , focuses on the perception of speech by ear and eye . massaro reviews the most significant empirical findings in that domain , discusses the main methodological issues , and presents a general classification of the existing computational models of bimodal speech perception . central to this section is the idea that speech perception obeys a general behavioural principle of integration between different sources of information . section 2 , "" broadening the domain "" , aims at assessing how well this mn principle holds up across broad individual and situational variability . the author demonstrates that tq inter-individual variations in how bimodal speech is perceived , depending on the listener 's age or native language for instance , can be accounted for within the flmp framework . using examples taken from different perceptual and cognitive situations , massaro also defends the idea that the flmp adequately describes information processing irrespective of these situational differences . section 3 , "" broadening the framework "" , opens with a presentation of an extended and more explicit version of the flmp , designed in particular to account for the dynamics of speech processing . the section also includes a detailed analysis of the methodological issues involved in assessing quantitative predictions in psychology , along with a discussion of the critiques expressed by other investigators about the flmp over the years . finally , section 4 , "" creating talking faces "" , is specifically dedicated to the synthesis of visual speech . 1 . 2 the new behavioural principle although many readers may already be familiar with massaro 's fuzzy logical model of perception , i shall here assume the contrary , and proceed to present a brief outline of the model . a central assumption of the flmp is that pattern recognition involves a common set of processes regardless of the specific nature of the patterns . speech is not seen as being associated with a dedicated processing module , as in the motor theory of speech perception ( liberman , 1996 ) for instance . on the contrary , the sensory information is assumed to be processed in the same way whether our brain is busy recognizing speech sounds , letters , or manual gestures , to take but a few examples . in any of these cases , the flmp postulates that mapping a stimulus into a unique perceptual category entails going through three main stages of processing , the feature evaluation stage , the feature integration stage , and the decision stage . the evaluation stage consists of converting the available sources of information into a set of properties referred to as features . each feature is given a continuous ( fuzzy truth ) value , and represents the degree to which the stimulus corresponds to each of a set of internal prototypical patterns , along a particular perceptual dimension . thus , one important visual feature in the perception of cv syllables is the degree of opening of the lips . the model therefore assumes that the internal prototypes available to the perceptual system will specify that the lips are open at the onset of the syllable for / da / , closed for / ba / , etc . in a second stage , the features are integrated with each other , so as to determine the overall degree of match of the sensory input with each of the prototypes ( e . g . each of the syllables known to the receiver ) . in the third and final stage , a decision is taken , on the basis of the relative goodness of match of the input with each prototype . the flmp makes a number of specific assumptions at each stage in this process . first , it hypothesizes that all of the available sources of information are simultaneously brought into play in pattern recognition . thus , visible speech and auditory speech are both assumed to have an influence on how bimodal speech is perceived . second , different sources of information are assumed to be evaluated independently of each other . this means for example that visible speech does not have any effect on how auditory speech is converted into a set of features , the two sources of information being combined at a later stage of processing only . the model also makes specific assumptions about how sources of information are integrated with each other ( multiplicative rule ) , and about how decisions are taken ( relative goodness rule ) . a major prediction of the model is that "" the influence of one source of information is greatest when the other source is neutral or ambiguous "" ( 19 ) . this prediction is best illustrated by an experiment whose results served as a database for testing models of pattern recognition on several occasions in the book ( chapters 2 and 11 ) . in this experiment , synthetic auditory stimuli ranging on a continuum between / ba / and / da / were crossed with visual stimuli also varying between / ba / and / da / . the bimodal stimuli were presented to subjects in a forced-choice identification task , along with each of the unimodal stimuli . ( this expanded factorial design is shown by massaro to be the most appropriate experimental design for determining how two sources of information are combined with each other in pattern recognition . ) for the bimodal stimuli , the main results are typically depicted as a two-factor plot , with the proportion of / da / responses on the ordinate , the levels of the auditory source of information on the abscissa , and a different curve for each of the levels of the visual source of information . when represented in that way , the results clearly show a statistical interaction between the two sources of information . specifically , the influence of one source of information proves to be larger in the middle , ambiguous range of the other source . this interaction graphically takes the shape of an american football , which is for this reason presented throughout the book as the hallmark of the the fuzzy logical model of perception . in summary , massaro proposes a universal principle of perceptual cognitive performance to explain pattern recognition . according to this principle , "" people are influenced by multiple sources of information in a diverse set of situations . in many cases , these sources of information are ambiguous and any particular source alone does not usually specify the appropriate interpretation . the perceiver appears to evaluate the multiple sources of information in parallel for the degree to which each supports various interpretations , integrate them together to derive the overall support for each interpretation , assess the support of each alternative based on all of the alternatives , and select the most appropriate response . "" ( p . 291 ) . 2 critical evaluation 2 . 1 general evaluation this book is clearly a major contribution to the study of speech perception and , more generally , to cognitive psychology . it is admirably clear and is written in quite an elegant manner . i do not doubt that the book will be read with great interest by research scientists from many different fields . this work is the result of an ambitious intellectual endeavour aimed at introducing a new behavioural law , which is placed by massaro on an equal footing with weber 's law of perception , or the power law of learning . speech scientists are presented with an extensive series of experiments on the perception of bimodal speech . whatever stance they take in that domain , they should find quite challenging massaro 's view that speech perception constitutes but one aspect of a much more general form of cognitive processing , namely pattern recognition . computer scientists working in the field of speech technology should be particularly interested in the book 's final section about the synthesis of visual speech . regardless of their background , readers should also find the book worth using as a tutorial on the experimental methods available for investigating speech perception . a great variety of experimental paradigms and tasks are discussed at length by massaro , who also extensively discusses the methods for assessing computational models of pattern recognition and , in particular , for fitting these models to observed results . in that respect , using the results of the experiment described above as a reference database was quite a good initiative in my view , as this allows the reader more easily to understand massaro 's point as new issues are raised , without having again to go through the details of the experimental design each time . the book should also prove an invaluable resource for teaching . care was taken to select prototypical results , as well as to set this work in its historical context . a number of rather fascinating anecdotes and historical references are given , going from mcgurk 's personal account of the discovery of the mcgurk effect , to an audio-visual rendition of the introduction to george miller 's seminal article on the ubiquitousness of the number 7 plus or minus 2 , with miller 's face texture-mapped onto baldi bb 's wire-frame head . the cd-rom that accompanies the book enables the reader directly to experience the psychological illusions associated with the perception of bimodal speech , and constitutes as such a most useful research and teaching tool . on the negative side , massaro 's use of the / ba / - / da / experiment as a leading strand throughout obviously results in the book being focused on the perception of non-sense syllables . although the interaction of visible speech and audible speech in word recognition is mentioned on a number of occasions ( e . g . pp 21-23 and pp . 181-182 ) , the book contains few suggestions as to how we perceive isolated words , let alone connected speech . i also was surprised by the fact that little place was devoted to presenting other current theories and models of speech perception . although models such as trace are mentioned on several occasions in the book , i think it is fair to say that the flmp is still given the lion 's share . the book also has some minor defects such as the absence of a list of figures , and the fact that some of the cd-rom bands ( 1 . 4 , 1 . 5 and 1 . 6 ) are referred to incorrectly in the text . the list of the cd-rom selections should have pointed to the pages where each band is referred to . in another domain , it would have been quite interesting to have the perceptual database used in the book made available on the cd-rom . although this would have probably required a substantial amount of additional work , i should also have found it useful to be provided with an interactive version of the main computational models discussed in the book ( flmp , the race model , the single channel model , etc . ) . the flmp model can be downloaded from massaro 's laboratory web site at santa cruz ( http the feature evaluation stage , the feature integration stage , and the decision stage . specific assumptions are made in the model about how features are integrated with each other , and how a decision is taken depending on the outcome of this integration . from a set of feature values , therefore , the model will predict the probability of occurrence of each possible response ( e . g . "" ba "" and "" da "" ) . however , attention should be paid to the fact that these feature values are in no way derived from the stimulus . they are actually determined in an posteriori manner , from the subjects ' observed responses , using an algorithm ( stepit ) which allows the deviation between these responses and the predicted ones to be minimal . features are seen in the model as * free parameters * , whose values are set on the basis of the actual performance of the subject in the pattern recognition task , so as to make the model perform at its best , i . e . to maximize its goodness of fit . according to massaro , "" [ the model is ] * predicting * the exact * form * of the results , but * postdicting * the actual quantitative * values * that make up the overall predictions "" ( p . 294 , his emphasis ) . in other words , the stimulus is on no occasion explicitly mapped onto the internal features of the flmp model . in that respect , features as defined in the flmp look markedly different from phonetic features . let us take for example the opposition between / ba / and / da / , on which much emphasis is put in the book . acoustically , / b / and / d / are said to differ from each other according to the feature grave-acute , / b / being classified as grave and / d / as acute . as is the case with flmp features , grave and acute can be viewed as target values referring to prototypical stops . however , the grave-acute feature is explicitly defined in acoustical terms ( e . g . slope of the short-term spectrum at the release of the stop , see stevens & blumstein , 1978 ) . on the contrary , the exact nature of the flmp features remains undetermined , their values being subject to one main constraint which is to make the model account for the subjects ' responses as accurately as possible . thus , the acoustic structure of the mn stimulus is not directly taken into consideration in the estimation of the feature values . in the experiments using audible speech , flmp features do lend themselves to an acoustic interpretation . in the / ba / - / da / experiment for example , the prototypes for / ba / and / da / are assumed to include one auditory feature , namely the variations in frequency of the second ( f2 ) and third ( f3 ) formants at the onset of the vowel ( slightly falling f2-f3 for / da / , rising f2-f3 for / ba / ) . however , this interpretation stems from the fact that f2 and f3 onset frequencies were precisely the acoustic parameters manipulated by the experimenters to synthesize the auditory continuum between / ba / and / da / . in other words , the acoustic significance of the flmp features is derived from the way in which the experiment has been designed . the model does rely on a particular system of acoustic features ( see for example stevens & blumstein , 1978 , for an alternative system ) , but this system is embodied in the experimental design , and is as such external to the model itself . in practice , therefore , the issue of how speech sounds are mapped onto features is not addressed in the model . why this is so is not clear to me . on several occasions , massaro suggests that determining in advance how a given individual will convert a given stimulus into a set of feature values is simply out of our reach . this stimulus-to - feature mapping shows a variability which is said to be analogous to the variability of the weather a special code ( mit press , cambridge , mass . ) . mcclelland , j . l .

62,"turkish jaklin kornfilt ( 1997 ) , turkish . london and new york the descriptive grammars are intended for linguists rather than general users . all of the grammars in the series address the same issues in a uniform format so that a given feature may be easily compared across languages , and they contain information of a sort that is often absent from more traditional grammars . toward the end of the review i will comment briefly on the potential utility of this grammar for tq non-linguists , but for the most part i will focus on usefulness of the grammar for linguists . the descriptive grammars series now includes nearly 30 titles . according to the editorial preface , the series gives preference to languages for which comprehensive descriptions are not presently available ( iv ) . the aim of the series is to provide information to linguists who are interested in language typology , language universals , and comparative grammar , employing a terminology and a notation that will make the information tq accessible to linguists regardless of their particular specialization or orientation . authors of the grammars in the series are expected to organize their descriptions as answers to a series of questions ( originally published in lingua vol . 42 , no . 1 , 1977 ) . turkish contains over 600 pages , including the prefatory material , the table of contents , and the bibliography . the grammatical description alone amounts to just over 550 pages . it is thus roughly twice as long as lewis ( 1967 ) and about 100 pages longer than underhill ( 1976 ) . the book contains five chapters of widely varying lengths . chapter 1 ( syntax ) contains 211 pages , chapter 2 ( morphology ) 270 pages , chapter 3 ( phonology ) 32 pages , chapter 4 ideophones and interjections ) just 3 pages , and chapter 5 ( lexicon ) 16 pages . thus approximately 90 per cent of the book is devoted to morphology and syntax . furthermore , a good deal of the information in mn the morphology chapter deals with syntactic matters , giving the book an especially heavy bias toward syntax . . this distribution of information no doubt reflects both the interests of the author and the current emphasis of typological research . the chapters on phonology and the lexicon are both very well done and very useful ( more on this below ) , but they do not address all of the issues that might be of interest to a phonologist or a lexical semanticist . a notable feature of the book is the extensive and detailed table of contents . it is eleven pages long and , used in conjunction with the fourteen-page index , provides easy access to the an extensive body of information about turkish . how well does turkish accomplish its goals ? i think it handles syntax and morphology marvelously well , phonology and the lexicon adequately , and ideophones and interjections in a cursory fashion . the chapters on syntax and morphology provide the best , most detailed descriptions of these parts of the language available . the analyses are up to date and insightful , and kornfilt has done a superb job of bringing clarity to some of the most difficult parts of the language . in concept and terminology , the description straddles the line between generative and traditional or non-generative approaches . for instance , kornfilt uses the terms ' possessive adjective ' ( 105 ) and 'd emonstrative adjective ( 106 ) rather than the more usual ' possessive ' and 'd emonstrative . ' similarly , the descriptions are stated in terms of surface phenomena and grammatical constructions and not in any recognizable theoretical framework . this is probably the right choice , given the diverse backgrounds of the probable users of the grammar . the range of coverage is broad and thorough . kornfilt deals with sentence types , both simple and complex ; with negation and questions ; with grammatical categories and phrase types ; and with most of the other grammatical phenomena that might interest linguists . the morphology chapter contains information not just on inflection and derivation , but also on the uses of the various morphological forms . cross - referencing is extensive , making it easy for the reader to find all of the relevant information on a topic even if it is not found in the same section of the book . this approach of interrelating syntax and morphology is very useful and allows kornfilt to clarify some of the cloudy areas of turkish grammar . perhaps most notable are her treatments of the participial and nominal systems and their relation to subordination ( pp . 323-413 and at various places in chapter 1 ) . finite subordination is rare in turkish . a far more frequent pattern of subordination involves the use of a participial or nominalized verbal stem . the complexity of the system is mind-boggling to students of the language , but kornfilt 's description makes it coherent and intelligible . her treatment of other aspects of turkish morphology and syntax are equally well done . a very useful feature of turkish is the inclusion of information about what does * not * occur in the language . this is often essential information for linguists ( whether studying typology , syntax , or morphology ) and is rarely included in more traditional grammars . thus we find on page 104 the statement that postpostitions govern only one case ( with the lone exception of ' kadar ' ) . in lewis ( 1967 ) , this information can be inferred from the discussion of cases on pages 85-95 , but it is not so easy to find and not so categorically stated . there are many similar examples , especially in the syntax chapter . the chapter on phonology is short , clear , and precise , but it does not contain the amount of detail found in the syntax and morphology chapters . while the information presented will be adequate for many purposes , phonologists will no doubt wish for more elaborate discussions of issues like vowel harmony , stress assignment , and phonological ( or morphophonemic ) alternations . i found one omission in this chapter . on page 491 , the final devoicing rule is described as applying to syllable-final plosives and affricates , yet on page 487 there are examples of final devoicing of liquids as well , described as being standard but not universal . a cross-reference would have been useful here . for the most part , transcriptions in the phonology chapter follow the ipa norms . one exception , though , is the transcription of palatalized consonants by means of a comma rather than a raised j . ' while this may have been done for typographical reasons , it might confuse a casual user . chapter 4 , ideophones and interjections , is only 3 pages long and provides only the briefest commentary on these phenomena . while many linguists ( myself included ) will not mind the short shrift given to these topics , some will no doubt be disappointed that the list of ideophones occupies less than a page and a half . chapter 5 , lexicon , is a short but interesting sample of the lexicon of turkish . the chapter contains lists of words organized by semantic field . these include kinship terminology , color terms , body parts , and cooking terminology . also included is a list of just over 200 items of "" basic vocabulary , "" which seems to correspond to the so-called swadesh list . linguists interested in historical linguistics and language classification will be grateful to find this set of words conveniently collected together . setting aside some minor qualifications , as a reference work on turkish for linguists , turkish has no equal . it is more comprehensive , more up to date , and more effectively organized than any other description of the language . the method of organization , as well as the detailed table of contents and the index , make a wealth of information available almost instantaneously . it is , simply put , an admirable reference work on turkish for linguists . the same can not be said about the utility of turkish for non-linguists . there are two main reasons why the book will not be accessible to non-linguistic audiences . first , kornfilt assumes familiarity with linguistic terminology . in the very first paragraph on page 1 , for example , she uses the terms ' nominalized clause ' and ' constituent clause , ' neither of which is likely to be familiar to non-linguists . second , turkish presupposes an interest in and a knowledge of certain linguistic questions . kornfilt has little to say , for example , about questions of stylistic variation , formal versus colloquial speech , or any of a range of topics that the typical student or scholar of turkish might be interested in . this is not really a criticism , since the descriptive grammar series has a well defined audience that excludes non-linguists . nevertheless , it is unfortunate that the grammar will not be useful to a wider audience . it will supplement but will not replace lewis ( 1976 ) and underhill ( 1976 ) . i have just two complaints about turkish . first , there is a relatively large number of errors and inconsistencies . most are minor and consist of missing ' - s 's on verbs , using ' of ' for ' or , ' etc . , but some will cause confusion . on page 27 , for example , turkish is described as a 's ubject-verb - object language . ' ( it is actually s - o - v . ) a sentence on page 30 , which addresses the of question whether pied-piping of postpositions is obligatory , leaves the reader unsure of the answer . there are also some contradictions . on page 142 , the claim is made that the reflexive can never occur in subject position , but on page 305 we learn that the reflexive can occur as an honorific subject and on page 542 three references are given to works that discuss reflexive subjects in subordinate clauses . other inconsistencies are found in the bibliography , where some turkish titles are translated into english and others are not . the author is aware of some of the errors and has prepared an addendum which contains a short list of errata , but many of the errors that i found are not included . the addendum is available free of charge from the author or the publisher . my other complaint concerns the cost cf of turkish . at us $ 180 , the grammar is unlikely to find its way into many private libraries . this is unfortunate ; since the book is so useful , linguists interested in turkish will want to have it close at hand . references lewis , g . l .

206,"basic order ( and remarks on typology ) last week i asked for references to discussions of a problem that comes up in linguistic typology george huttar , yehuda falk , dan everett , larry trask , jon aske , mike maxwell , mark newson , bill croft , georgia green , ingo plag , randy harris , and andrew carstairs - mccarthy . i was quite surprised at the small amount of published attention that there is to this problem . i was pointed to short discussions ( no more than a couple pages ) in some of the major works devoted to typology neither nichols or anyone else could have profound first-hand knowledge of more than a small handful of the 174 languages in the data base . i suspect that in most cases nichols could not know what criteria were applied to type a language in the sources she consulted , because many sources are insufficiently explicit on that point or take as self-evident some categorization that another would take as controversial or simply wrong . ( consider , for example , her typing french as vso . ) there were , to be sure , cases where nichols threw out some language from the sample of some particular feature because of its obvious ambiguous status with respect to that feature . but doing so could have created more problems than it solved . as both aske and croft pointed out in their postings to me , if a language is ' inconsistent ' with respect to a particular feature , bb that too is typological data ; data moreover that could be highly relevant to conclusions about stability and diversity over time . in a sample of 174 languages , misassignment of several languages within a category with a 3 - way division could lead to rather different conclusions . likewise , so would postulating a different set of categories or having categories specifically for ' mixed ' types . this is beginning to sound like a critique of nichols , but i do bb n't mean it to be . rather , it is more a commentary on the shaky art of typological pigeon-holeing that underlies not just conclusions about language prehistory , but also much functionalist theorizing and - - increasingly - - bb generative theorizing as well . there is also the question of sample * size * . typologists mn strive , quite reasonably , to correct for genetic and areal biases in their samples ( the most heroic effort along these lines that i know of is dryer 's work ) . but how confident can we be of any attempt to eliminate bias from the sample , given nichols ' conclusions that influences can extend half-way around the globe ? and does n't that present a challenge to purported explanations of the relative frequency of some typological feature , which are common in the functionalist literature and increasingly so in the generative ? so much could be the result of historical accident on the one hand and contact and descent on the other , rather than the product of ' external ' functional forces or the design of ug . the smaller the sample of languages where mutual influence or common descent is not a possibility , the more likely that some implicational typological relation is artifactual . and the more reason we have to think that there are a lot of typologically possible but - - purely by chance - - nonexisting languages . fritz newmeyer fjn u . washington . edu ps : with respect to the last point , alan bell has shown that if some feature appears in 1 % of the world 's languages ( say , 40-50 languages ) , it will show up only about 50 % of the time in a random sample of 75 languages . you 'd need a sample of over 200 languages before it could be counted on to show up 90 % of the time . and we are assuming here , utterly counterfactually , that there are no genetic relations or areal influences between languages .",1,1

220,""" i ' m keeping an eye on the westfield accent uproar because it 's not far from here and there 's something about cf it in the paper almost every day , including editorials . i ' ll be glad to help keep you updated on news , and i would appreciate receiving any references you find out about to research that shows that the parents have nothing to worry about . ( an article in a local paper today , about reactions , said in the last paragraph "" linguists said that , as long as the teacher is comprehensible , parents concerned about having a good "" model "" in the classroom to help their children become americanized quickly in their speech have little to worry about . "" but no names or references . ) what happened was that early last week a petition signed by 403 residents of westfield , mass . was given to the school board in response to a decision to reassign two bilingual education teachers to positions as normal classroom teachers . the petition urges that no teacher be assigned to first or second grades "" who is not thoroughly proficient in the english language in terms of grammar , syntax , and - most important - the accepted and standardized use of pronunciation . "" the mayor of the city , a greek immigrant with an accent , and a proponent of english - only laws , and chair of the city 's school committee , has been vocally in favor of the petition . it has been denounced by the state 's secretary of education , piedad robertson , a native of cuba and a former kindergarten teacher herself , who immediately came out with the statement that the proposal "" would appear to be discrimination , plain and simple . . . . this petition , instead of fostering the acceptance of cultural diversity , would appear to encourage bigotry , racism , and discrimination . "" the mayor in a phone interview june 30 dismissed her attack as "" bovine scatology . "" the state 's attorney general has offered th opinion that the plan would almost certainly violate the state 's anti-discrimination laws . an article today ( both articles i ' m quoting from are in the daily hampshire gazette , of northampton , though there was also a mention in sunday 's nytimes ) says the mayor , george varelas , says he has been getting calls from all over the country , mostly agreeing with his point of view . the two parents who started the drive are expressing great surprise ; the wife , "" who is of spanish and portuguese descent , has become so distraught over accusations of bigotry . . . that she has taken to avoiding people . "" the city has about 36000 population and a broad ethnic mix . but like most of what one reads about the english only movement , there 's a great deal of debate about whether it 's racist or xenophobic , etc . , and very little about the fundamental question that you raised , namely does it in fact have any effect on the acquisition of english by the children in the classes ? "" throughout last week , i was forwarding the responses to barbara and she was updating the story as things evolved . on july the 8th , she was contacted by a reporter of the westfield paper , and she asked me for ( and , of course , received ) permission to use the materials i had in her interview with the paper . on july the 9th , barbara wrote "" my own rather limited experience is that children are n't even influenced by the foreign accents of their _ parents _ , much less teachers . "" cliff miller ( miller defun . cs . utah . edu ) does it matter ? i grew up in several different places and my english has undergone a number of shifts - - i even had a japanese accent for a while . my english is quite tq native now and i do n't think that the different stages it went through did it any harm . . . . "" craig thiersch ( thiersch kub . nl ) it 's more or less common knowledge that children virtually always acquire the accent of their peers , not that of parents , teachers , or other adults . i can think of countless examples from my own experience "" i was interested in learning that your daughter never acquired the pronunciations of the 3 adults at home , when they differed from , i assume , the local dialect . i can add that our 9 & 12 year olds do not have any of their father 's quebec french pronunciations or translations in their speech and on occasions when they have had his speech forms / usage , they seem to get cf rid of it when they learn the local dialect . that is , his speech does not persist in theirs . they also recently asked me if i thought that daddy had a foreign accent . they said they did n't think so . i must admit , that i have to stop and think a second before i realize that he does indeed have an accent , and that on reflection , our kids will admit to it too . but there is a sense in which we do n't think on a minute to minute basis of him as speaking differently from us , though certain pronunciations or translations on occasion may strike us noticeably . i 'd imagine that students in a class with a nonnative teacher muight have the same perceptions , esp . if the teacher is fluent in english , although having an accent . this is a good "" applied linguistics "" example . "" the only references that the discussion has yielded so far were contributed by catherine doughty mn and susan ervin - tripp . catherine doughty ( catherine . doughty linguistics . su . edu . au ) "" it would be nearly impossible for a child to be influenced by the accent of a grade school teacher unless it was the prestige accent of the community , and the child knew it . as labov showed convincingly , kids get their accents from their peers . on the other hand , i ran into some reported cases of children who preserved the accents of their immigrant parents , but these were unusual cases of socially isolated children . for example , in the clinical literature i found a case of an 8 year old who immigrated at 3 , and still had "" his father 's accent "" . as he was psychoanalyzed ( ! ) he lost his accent , spoke like his peers , and became able to mimic the accent at will . buxbaum , psychoanalytic quarterly , 18 , 279-289 ( 1949 ) .
